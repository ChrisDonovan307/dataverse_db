# Introduction

Dataverse scraping for CS5040 - Database Systems course. To navigate project, open `.Rproj` file, then head to `table_of_conents.R`. Scripts are listed in order. To navigate to a script, put cursor on file path and hit `F2`, or `ctrl + left click` on the file path. The `6_outputs` folder contains csv outputs to work with in RDBMS. They still need some work in terms of creating and linking keys across tables.
