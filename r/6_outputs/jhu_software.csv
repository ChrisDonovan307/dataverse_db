--------------------

'Fig3-Individual-Synapses.py'
Replicates the results reported in Figure 3. These simulations systematically activate each of the 3,121 KC>MBON-a3 synapses to determine the effects of single synapse activation on the local dendritic segment, proximal neurite, and soma. Additionally outputs the image of MBON-a3 with all synaptic sections colored in red. 

--------------------

'Fig4-KC-Activation.py'
Replicates the results reported in Figure 4. These simulations systematically activate all of the synaptic sites associated with each KC and record the effects of KC activation on MBON-a3.

--------------------

'Fig5-KC-Synaptic-Plasticity.py'
Replicates the results reported in Figure 5. These simulations activate the synapses associated with a population of KCs, with parameter options to modify the number of recruited KCs and/or the synaptic strength.",NA
