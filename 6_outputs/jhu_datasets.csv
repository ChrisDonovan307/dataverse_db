From the publication abstract: Many biological phenomena such as locomotion, circadian cycles and breathing are rhythmic in nature and can be modelled as rhythmic dynamical systems. Dynamical systems modelling often involves neglecting certain characteristics of a physical system as a modelling convenience. For example, human locomotion is frequently treated as symmetric about the sagittal plane. In this work, we test this assumption by examining human walking dynamics around the steady state (limit-cycle). Here, we adapt statistical cross-validation in order to examine whether there are statistically significant asymmetries and, even if so, test the consequences of assuming bilateral symmetry anyway. Indeed, we identify significant asymmetries in the dynamics of human walking, but nevertheless show that ignoring these asymmetries results in a more consistent and predictive model. In general, neglecting evident characteristics of a system can be more than a modelling convenience—it can produce a better model.","Ankarali, Mustafa M.; Long, Andrew; Bastian, Amy J.; Cowan, Noah J., 2015, ""Data associated with publication &ldquo;Walking dynamics are symmetric (enough)&rdquo;"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T15Q4T12"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T15Q4T12</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V5","2015-08-25T00:00:00Z","JHU LIMBS Laboratory Data Archive","Ankarali, Mustafa M.; Long, Andrew; Bastian, Amy J.; Cowan, Noah J., 2015, ""Data associated with publication “Walking dynamics are symmetric (enough)”"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T15Q4T12, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V5",38

NO2-responsive polymer-based organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are described and room-temperature detection with high sensitivity entirely from the semiconductor was achieved. Two thiophene polymers, poly(bisdodecylquaterthiophene) and poly(bisdodecylthioquaterthiophene) (PQT12 and PQTS12, respectively), were used as active layers to detect a concentration at least as low as 1 ppm NO2. The proportional on-current change of OFETs using these polymers reached over 400% for PQTS12, which is among the highest sensitivities reported for an NO2-responsive device based on an organic semiconducting film. From measurements of cyclic voltammetry and the electronic characteristics, we found that the introduction of sulfurs into the side chains induces traps in films of the PQTS12 and also decreases domain sizes, both of which could contribute to the higher sensitivity of PQTS12 to NO2 gas compared to PQT12. The ratio of responses of PQTS12 and PQT12 is higher for exposures to lower concentrations, making this parameter a means of distinguishing responses to low concentrations for extended times from exposures to high concentrations from shorter times. The responses to nonoxidizing vapors were much lower indicating good selectivity to NO2 of two polymers.

Rhythmic major-element zoning in garnet is a common product of such metamorphism, and one that must record a fundamental subduction process. Here we show that rhythmic major-element zoning in subduction-zone garnets from the Franciscan Complex, California developed in response to growth–dissolution cycles driven by pressure pulses. Using electron probe microanalysis and novel techniques in Raman and synchrotron Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, we demonstrate that at least four such pressure pulses, of magnitude 100–350 MPa, occurred over less than 300,000 years. These pressure magnitude and time scale constraints are most consistent with the garnet zoning having resulted from periodic overpressure development–dissipation cycles, related to pore-fluid pressure fluctuations linked to earthquake cycles. This study demonstrates that some metamorphic reactions can track individual earthquake cycles, and thereby opens new avenues to the study of seismicity.","Viete, Daniel R.; Hacker, Bradley R.; Allen, Mark B.; Seward, Gareth G.

Air stable and soluble tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF), is demonstrated as an efficient n-type dopant for the conjugated polymer ClBDPPV. Electron transfer from F− anions to the π-electron deﬁcient polymer ClBDPPV through anion-π electronic interactions is strongly corroborated by the combined the results of electron spin resonance (ESR), UV-Vis-NIR and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Doping of ClBDPPV with 25 mol% TBAF boosts electrical conductivity to up to 0.62 S cm-1, among the highest conductivities that has been reported for solution processed n-type conjugated polymers, with a thermoelectric power factor of 0.63 μW m−1 K−2 in air. Importantly, the Seebeck coefficient agrees with recently published correlations to conductivity. Moreover, the F- doped ClBDPPV shows significant air stability, maintaining the conductivity of over 0.1 S cm-1 in a thick film after exposure to air for one week, to the best of our knowledge the first report of an air stable solution processable n-doped conductive polymer with this level of conductivity. The result shows that using solution processable small-anion salts such as TBAF as a n-dopant of organic conjugated polymers possessing lower LUMO (< -4.2 eV) can open new opportunities toward high performance air stable solution processable n-type thermoelectric conjugated polymers.","Zhao, Xingang; Madan, Deepa; Cheng, Yan; Zhou, Jiawang; Li, Hui; Thon, Susanna M.; Bragg, Arthur E.; DeCoster, Mallory E.; Hopkins, Patrick E.; Katz, Howard E., 2017, ""Current-voltage, voltage-temperature, cyclic voltammetry, morphological, and spectroscopic raw data"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/CZZDLJ"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/CZZDLJ</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2017-06-22T13:24:47Z","Dr. Howard Katz DOE-supported projects","Zhao, Xingang; Madan, Deepa; Cheng, Yan; Zhou, Jiawang; Li, Hui; Thon, Susanna M.; Bragg, Arthur E.; DeCoster, Mallory E.; Hopkins, Patrick E.; Katz, Howard E., 2017, ""Current-voltage, voltage-temperature, cyclic voltammetry, morphological, and spectroscopic raw data"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/CZZDLJ, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",6

Four p-type polymers were synthesized by modifying poly(bisdodecylquaterthiophene) (PQT12) to increase oxidizability by p-dopants. A sulfur atom is inserted between the thiophene rings and dodecyl chains, and/or 3,4-ethylenedioxy groups are appended to thiophene rings of PQT12. Doped with NOBF4, PQTS12 (with sulfur in side chains) shows conductivity of 350 S cm-1, the highest reported nonionic conductivity among films made from dopant-polymer solutions. Doped with tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ), PDTDE12 (with 3,4-ethylenedioxy groups on thiophene rings) shows conductivity of 140 S cm-1. The converse combinations of polymer and dopant, and formulations using a polymer with both the sulfur and ethylenedioxy modifications showed lower conductivities. The conductivities are stable in air without extrinsic ion contributions associated with PEDOT:PSS and that cannot support sustained current or thermoelectric voltage. Efficient charge transfer, tighter π-π stacking and strong intermolecular coupling are responsible for the conductivity. Values of nontransient Seebeck coefficient and conductivity agree with empirical modeling for materials with these levels of pure hole conductivity; the power factor compares favorably with prior p-type polymers made by the alternative process of immersion of polymer films into dopant solutions. Models and conductivities point to significant mobility increases induced by dopants, on the order of 1-5 cm2 V-1 s-1, supported by field-effect transistor studies of slightly doped samples. The thermal conductivities were in the range of 0.2 ~ 0.5 W m-1 K-1, typical for conductive polymers.

Layer-by-layer deposited guanine and pentacene in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) is introduced. Through adjusting the layer thickness ratio of guanine and pentacene, the tradeoff of two electronic parameters in OFETs, charge carrier mobility and current on/off ratio, was controlled. The charge mobility was enhanced by depositing the pentacene over and between guanine layers and by increasing the proportion of pentacene in the layer-by-layer system, while the current on/off ratio was increased via the decreased off current induced by the guanine layers. The tunable device performance was mainly ascribed to the trap and dopant neutralizing properties of the guanine layers, which would decrease the density of free hydroxyl groups in the OFETs. Furthermore, the cost of the devices could be reduced remarkably via the adoption of the low-cost guanine.","Shi, Wei; Zheng, Yifan; Taylor, Andr&eacute; D.; Yu, Junsheng; Katz, Howard E., 2017, ""Current-voltage raw data for transistors and micrograph morphology images for films"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/YI383C"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/YI383C</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2017-08-16T16:55:31Z","Dr. Howard Katz DOE-supported projects","Shi, Wei; Zheng, Yifan; Taylor, André D.; Yu, Junsheng; Katz, Howard E., 2017, ""Current-voltage raw data for transistors and micrograph morphology images for films"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/YI383C, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",3

Abstract: We demonstrate the ability to reduce the carrier concentration of thin films of the topological insulator (TI) Bi2Se3 by utilizing a nonvolatile electrostatic gating via corona charging of electret polymers. Sufficient electric field can be imparted to a polymer-TI bilayer to result in significant electron density depletion, even without the continuous connection of a gate electrode or the chemical modification of the TI. We show that the Fermi level of Bi2Se3 is shifted toward the Dirac point with this method. Using terahertz spectroscopy, we find that the surface chemical potential is lowered into the bulk band gap (approximately 50 meV above the Dirac point and 170 meV below the conduction-band minimum), and it is stabilized in the intrinsic regime while enhancing electron mobility. The mobility of surface state electrons is enhanced to a value as high as approximately 1600cm2/Vs at 5 K.","Ireland, R.

Extensive equatorial linear dunes exist on Titan, but the origin of the sand, which appears to be organic, is unknown. We used nanoindentation to study the mechanical properties of a few Titan sand candidates, several natural sands on Earth, and common materials used in the Titan Wind Tunnel, to understand the mobility of Titan sand. We measured the elastic modulus (E), hardness (H), and fracture toughness (Kc) of these materials. Tholin's elastic modulus (10.4+/-0.5 GPa) and hardness (0.53+/-0.03 GPa) are both an order of magnitude smaller than silicate sand, which is also smaller than the mechanically weak white gypsum sand. With a magnitude smaller fracture toughness (Kc=0.036+/-0.007 MPa-m^(1/2)), tholin is also much more brittle than silicate sand. This indicates that sand formation mechanisms that require liquid hydrocarbons must be possible in the equatorial regions or sand formation does not require liquid, because tholin is too soft and brittle to transport from the poles, where the current lakes and seas are, to the equator.","Yu, Xinting; H&ouml;rst, Sarah M.; He, Chao; McGuiggan, Patricia, 2018, ""Data associated with publication &ldquo;Where does Titan Sand Come From: Insight from Mechanical Properties of Titan Sand Candidates&rdquo;"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/TP9B4Y"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/TP9B4Y</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2018-06-13T13:46:01Z","Professor Sarah Hörst Research Group                                          ","Yu, Xinting; Hörst, Sarah M.; He, Chao; McGuiggan, Patricia, 2018, ""Data associated with publication “Where does Titan Sand Come From: Insight from Mechanical Properties of Titan Sand Candidates”"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/TP9B4Y, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",16

Intentional charging of polymer dielectrics in OFETs can change Vth and affect the bias stress. We describe a chemical design and fabrication protocol to construct multilayer-stack dielectrics for pentacene-based OFETs using different polystyrene (PS)-based polymers in each layer, with oxidizable N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)anilino (TPAOMe)-substituted styrene copolymers in arbitrary vertical positions in the stacks. Thermal, byproduct-free crosslinking of benzocyclobutene subunits provides integrity to the multilayer structure by preventing dissolution of the previous deposited layer. Neutron reflectivity data verified the multilayer morphology. We compared the Vth shift before and after charging the stacks by application of ±100V across 0.5-1 µm total film thicknesses. Bias stress was the dominant effect in bilayer devices with a TPAOMe layer in contact with the pentacene, indicated by the direction of Vth shift associated with either polarity of external electric field. In structures with no TPAOMe subunit in contact with the pentacene, when charging with -100V on top of the source and drain electrodes, electron injection from pentacene to dielectric was the major charging mechanism, again consistent with the bias stress direction. When charging with +100V, bilayer devices without TPAOMe showed little change in Vth, suggesting there was no bias stress effect or charge injection in these devices for this charging polarity. For the bilayer devices with the TPAOMe layer in the bottom, and the trilayer devices with TPOMe in the middle, when +100V was applied, the Vth shifts were opposite those expected from bias stress.

We examine the effect of the trifluoromethyl substituent on poly(3-trifluoromethylstyrene) (P3TFMS) as compared to unsubstituted polystyrene (PS) on the I-V relationships of pentacene-based organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Single- and double-layered films of these polymers were used, with lower layers crosslinked through vinylbenzocyclobutene comonomers before deposition of upper layers. Control experiments verified that the electronic effect of the crosslinking was negligible. We found that the TFM substituent markedly and independently affected both the initial threshold voltage Vth and the nonvolatile, shifted Vth observed after the application of static gate voltage, depending on its position adjacent or apart from the pentacene. The trifluoromethyl-bearing polymers exhibited significantly lower magnitude initial threshold voltages (Vth,i of ca. −17 V for P3TFMS compared to −35 V for PS), large threshold voltage shifts after charging by the application of static electric fields (ΔVth of ca. 32 V for P3TFMS and 17 V for PS), and greater stability of the ΔVth under repeated charge/discharge cycles. These results are consistent with P3TFMS having fewer interfacial trap states but more stable bulk trap states. The results are applicable to organo-electronic systems such as piezoelectrics for energy harvesting and nonvolatile OFETs such as memory, sensing, and logic elements.","Plunkett, Evan; Kale, Tejaswini S.; Zhang, Qingyang; Katz, Howard E.; Reich, Daniel H., 2019, ""Data associated with &quot;Effects of trifluoromethyl substituents on interfacial and bulk polarization of polystyrene gate dielectrics&quot;"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/V3Z6DD"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/V3Z6DD</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2019-01-23T20:57:15Z","Dr. Howard Katz DOE-supported projects","Plunkett, Evan; Kale, Tejaswini S.; Zhang, Qingyang; Katz, Howard E.; Reich, Daniel H., 2019, ""Data associated with ""Effects of trifluoromethyl substituents on interfacial and bulk polarization of polystyrene gate dielectrics"""", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/V3Z6DD, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",6

In this paper, we decouple the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, achieving increases in at least one of these two parameters while the other is maintained or slightly increased as well. This is done using an alkylthio-substituted polythiophene (PQTS12) as additive in poly(bisdodecylquaterthiophene) (PQT12) with tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) and nitrosyl tetrafluoroborate (NOBF4) as dopants. The power factor increased two orders of magnitude with the PQTS12 additive at constant doping level. Using a second pair of polymers, poly(2,5-bis(3-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (PBTTTC12) and poly(2,5-bis(3-dodecylthiothiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, (PBTTTSC12), with higher mobilities, we also observed the decoupling of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity, and achieved higher power factor. Distinguished from recently reported works, these two sets of polymers possess very closely offset carrier energy levels (0.05 ~ 0.07 eV), and the microstructure, assessed using grazing incidence X-ray scattering, and mobility evaluated in field-effect transistors, was not adversely affected by the blending. Experiments, calculations and simulations are consistent with the idea that blending and doping polymers with closely-spaced energy levels and compatible morphologies to promote carrier mobility favors increased power factors.","Li, Hui; Katz, Howard, 2019, ""Data associated with publication &ldquo;Dopant-Dependent Increase in Seebeck Coefficient and Electrical Conductivity in Blended Polymers with Offset Carrier Energies&quot;"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/BIJWVL"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/BIJWVL</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2019-03-12T11:16:00Z","Dr. Howard Katz DOE-supported projects","Li, Hui; Katz, Howard, 2019, ""Data associated with publication “Dopant-Dependent Increase in Seebeck Coefficient and Electrical Conductivity in Blended Polymers with Offset Carrier Energies"""", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/BIJWVL, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",5

Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) film doped using various concentrations of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) solutions imposed additional positive potentials on the P3HT RG, resulting in a lower threshold voltage (V_th) on the n-channel silicon FET. Changes in V_th were related to the induced hole concentrations and hole mobility in P3HT films by using our V_th shifting model for the RG FET. We discovered that the electron-donating P3HT and even inorganic materials, indium tin oxide and gold, showed similar electrical potential perturbations dependent on the concentration of F4TCNQ in overlying solutions as the dopant radical anions maximally covered the surfaces. This suggests that there are limited electroactive sites for F4TCNQ binding on electron donor surfaces which results in a similar number of positive charges in film materials forming dipoles with the F4TCNQ radical counteranions. The effect of electron acceptors such as 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane and tetracyanoethylene was compared with that of F4TCNQ in terms of V_th shift using our analytical tool, with differences attributed to acceptor size and reduction potential. Meanwhile, this FET analysis tool offered a means of monitoring the physical diffusion of small molecules, exemplified by F4TCNQ, in the passive polymer polystyrene, driven by concentration gradients.

Article abstract: Ionic doping effects in conjugated polymers often cause nonspecific signaling and a low selectivity of bioelectronic sensing. Using remote-gate field-effect transistor characterization of molecular and ionic doping in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and acid-functionalized polythiophene, poly[3-(3-carboxypropyl) thiophene-2,5-diyl] (PT-COOH), we discovered that proton doping effects on the interfacial potential occurring in P3HT could be suppressed by sequentially doping P3HT by 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ). To be specific, intrinsic pH sensitivity shown by pure P3HT (18 mV/pH in a range from pH 3 to 9) was fully dissipated for doped P3HT:F4TCNQ. However, F4TCNQ sequential doping instead increases pH sensitivity of acid-functionalized polythiophene, PT-COOH (40 mV/pH), compared to that of a pure PT-COOH (30 mV/pH). Interactions between polythiophene backbone and side chains, which constrain the activity of COOH, are weakened by stronger F4TCNQ doping leaving behind responsive COOH groups exposed to aqueous solutions. This is supported by the reduced pH sensitivity of PT-COOH sequentially doped by a weaker dopant, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) (21 mV/pH). Thus, doping is shown to stabilize a nonpolar conjugated polymer to pH-induced fluctuations on one hand, and to activate a COOH side chain to pH-induced response on the other.","Jang, Hyun-June; Song, Yunjia; Wagner, Justine; Katz, Howard E., 2021, ""Data associated with the publication: Suppression of ionic doping by molecular dopants in conjugated polymers for improving specificity and sensitivity in biosensing applications"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/ZOW11X"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/ZOW11X</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2021-02-01T15:16:20Z","Dr. Howard Katz NSF-supported projects","Jang, Hyun-June; Song, Yunjia; Wagner, Justine; Katz, Howard E., 2021, ""Data associated with the publication: Suppression of ionic doping by molecular dopants in conjugated polymers for improving specificity and sensitivity in biosensing applications"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/ZOW11X, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",2

Article abstract: A systematic analysis is used to understand electrical drift occurring in field‐effect transistor (FET) dissolved‐analyte sensors by investigating its dependence on electrode surface‐solution combinations in a remote‐gate (RG) FET configuration. Water at pH 7 and neat acetonitrile, having different dipoles and polarizabilities, are applied to the RG surface of indium tin oxide, SiO2, hexamethyldisilazane‐modified SiO2, polystyrene, poly(styrene‐co‐acrylic acid), poly(3‐hexylthiophene‐2,5‐diyl) (P3HT), and poly [3‐(3‐carboxypropyl)thiophene‐2,5‐diyl] (PT‐COOH). It is discovered that in some cases a slow reorientation of dipoles at the interface induced by gate electric fields causes severe drift and hysteresis because of induced interface potential changes. Conductive and charged P3HT and PT‐COOH increase electrochemical stability by promoting fast surface equilibrations. It is also demonstrated that pH sensitivity of P3HT (17 mV per pH) is an indication of proton doping. PT‐COOH shows further enhanced pH sensitivity (30 mV per pH). This combination of electrochemical stability and pH response in PT‐COOH are proposed as advantageous for polymer‐based biosensors.","Jang, Hyun-June; Wagner, Justine; Song, Yunjia; Lee, Taein; Katz, Howard E., 2021, ""Data associated with the publication: Carboxylic acid-functionalized conjugated polymer promoting diminished electronic drift and amplified proton sensitivity of remote gates compared to nonpolar surfaces in aqueous media"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/KCIPSB"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/KCIPSB</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2021-02-01T15:15:59Z","Dr. Howard Katz NSF-supported projects","Jang, Hyun-June; Wagner, Justine; Song, Yunjia; Lee, Taein; Katz, Howard E., 2021, ""Data associated with the publication: Carboxylic acid-functionalized conjugated polymer promoting diminished electronic drift and amplified proton sensitivity of remote gates compared to nonpolar surfaces in aqueous media"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/KCIPSB, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",5

From the abstract: The development of high-performance-conjugated polymer-based gas sensors involves detailed structural tailoring such that high sensitivities are achieved without compromising the stability of the fabricated devices. In this work, we systematically developed a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymer semiconductors by modifying the polymer backbone to achieve and rationalize enhancements in gas sensitivities and electronic stability in air. NO2- and NH3-responsive polymer-based organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are described with improved air stability compared to all-thiophene conjugated polymers. Five DPP–fluorene-based polymers were synthesized and compared to two control polymers and used as active layers to detect a concentration of NO2 at least as low as 0.5 ppm. The hypothesis that the less electron-donating fluorene main-chain subunit would lead to increased signal/drift compared to thiophene and carbazole subunits was tested. The sensitivities exhibited a bias voltage-dependent behavior. The proportional on-current change of OFETs using a dithienyl DPP–fluorene polymer reached ∼614% for an exposure to 20 ppm of NO2 for 5 min, testing at a bias voltage of −33 V, among the higher reported NO2 sensitivities for conjugated polymers. Electronic and morphological studies reveal that introduction of the fluorene unit in the DPP backbone decreases the ease of backbone oxidation and induces traps in the thin films. The combination of thin-film morphology and oxidation potentials governs the gas-absorbing properties of these materials. The ratio of responses on exposure to NO2 and NH3 compared to drifts while taking the device through repeated gate voltage sweeps is the highest for two polymers incorporating electron-donating linkers connecting the DPP and thiophene units in the backbone, in this category of organic semiconductors. The responses to NO2 were much larger than that to NH3, indicating increased susceptibility to oxidizing vs reducing gases, and that the capability of oxidizing gases to induce additional charge density has a more dramatic electronic effect than when reducing gases create traps. This work demonstrates the capability of achieving improved stability with the retention of high sensitivity in conjugated polymer-based OFET sensors by modulating redox and morphological properties of polymer semiconductors by structural control.","Mukhopadhyaya, Tushita; Wagner, Justine S.; Fan, Huidong; Katz, Howard E., 2021, ""Data associated with the publication: Design and synthesis of air-stable p-channel conjugated polymers for high signal-to-drift nitrogen dioxide and ammonia sensing"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/4WX5QC"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/4WX5QC</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2021-07-19T20:41:03Z","Dr. Howard Katz NSF-supported projects","Mukhopadhyaya, Tushita; Wagner, Justine S.; Fan, Huidong; Katz, Howard E., 2021, ""Data associated with the publication: Design and synthesis of air-stable p-channel conjugated polymers for high signal-to-drift nitrogen dioxide and ammonia sensing"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/4WX5QC, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",3

However, operationalising country ownership to ensure the scale up and sustainability of proven interventions remains elusive at best. To address this challenge, the authors undertook a thematic analysis of interviews collected from representatives of local governments, public health systems, and communities in poor urban areas of East Africa, Francophone West Africa, India, and Nigeria, supported by The Challenge Initiative (TCI), aiming to rapidly and sustainably scale up evidence-based reproductive health and family planning solutions. The main objective of the study was to explore critical elements needed for implementing and scaling evidence-based family planning interventions. The research team conducted thematic analysis of 96 stories collected using the Most Significant Change (MSC) technique between July 2018 and September 2019. After generating 55 unique codes, the codes were grouped into related themes, using TCI’s model as a general analytical framework. Five key themes emerged: (1) strengthening local capacity and improving broader health systems, (2) shifting mindsets of government and community toward local ownership, (3) institutionalizing the interventions within existing government structures, (4) improving data demand and use for better planning of health services, and (5) enhancing coordination of partners.

From the article abstract: Supramolecular materials derived from pi-conjugated peptidic macromolecules are well-established to self-assemble into 1D nanostructures. In the presence of KOH, which was used to more fully dissolve the peptide macromolecules prior to triggering the self-assembly by way of exposure to HCl vapor, we report here an unexpected mineralization of KCl as templated presumably by the glutamic acid residues that were present along the backbone of the peptide macromolecules. In order to decouple the peptidic side chains from the central pi-electron unit, three-carbon spacers were added between them on both sides. The assembled structures that resulted from the collective formation of β-sheets, π-orbital overlaps, and mineralization resulted in highly interconnected dendritic structures under suitable KOH concentrations. Electrical measurements indicated that when well-interconnected, these dendritic structures maintained conductivities comparable to those of metals at around 1800 S/cm. About 50 mA current was measured for 0.5 V/37.5 μm. Varying the gate voltage in a transistor configuration had no effect on the current levels, indicating a conductive instead of a semiconducting pathway. Control experiments without the peptide, measurements of conductivity over time, and conductivity quenching by ammonia suggested the conductivity of these dendritic networks was derived from proton doping of the central π-electron units in a strong acid environment and was facilitated by closely spaced chromophores, as suggested in the literature, leading to facile π-electron transfer along the interconnected dendritic pathways. Our findings suggest that mineralization templated by appropriate amino acids combined with peptide/π-electron self-assembly can lead to highly conductive dendritic macrostructures as well as control of nanowire growth in specific directions.","Lee, Taein; Panda, Sayak Subhra; Tovar, John D.; Katz, Howard E., 2021, ""Data associated with publication: Unusually conductive organic-inorganic hybrid nanostructures derived from bio-inspired mineralization of peptide/pi-electron assemblies"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/EWN8ZN"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/EWN8ZN</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2021-07-19T21:01:24Z","Dr. Howard Katz NSF-supported projects","Lee, Taein; Panda, Sayak Subhra; Tovar, John D.; Katz, Howard E., 2021, ""Data associated with publication: Unusually conductive organic-inorganic hybrid nanostructures derived from bio-inspired mineralization of peptide/pi-electron assemblies"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/EWN8ZN, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",4

Although Lewis acids such as B(C6F5)3have shown promise as dopants for polymers, their doping mechanism is not fully understood. We created 1:1 zwitterionic (including “Wheland-type”) complexes of B(C6F5)3 with conjugated molecules difluorobis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene (diF-TES-ADT) and didodecylthienothiophene (DTT-12) and characterized them with 1H NMR, UV−vis spectroscopy, EPR spectroscopy, optical and scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and X-ray diffraction. We employed these complexes as p-dopants for three conjugated polymers and established their doping abilities by conductivity measurements, Seebeck studies, field effect transistor (FET), and remote-gate sensing (RG-FET) measurements. Conductivity changes were dependent on the conjugated molecule adduct component, consistent with the adduct itself serving as the oxidant. The adduct complexes were capable of inducing changes in the surface potential of spun polymer films similar to the behavior shown by conventional dopants. Charge carrier density calculations by remote gate sensing revealed that these adducts can generate holes. We also studied the effect of adding the B(C6F5)3 first, followed by addition of the neat conjugated molecules; the observation of behavior that was different from that using preformed adducts was consistent with the adducts remaining intact during doping. When B(C6F5)3 was added to the polymers, followed by uncomplexed conjugated molecules, the generated hole carrier density is lower than that generated by the B(C6F5)3 dopant but often greater than that generated by the Wheland complexes, indicating a high probability of adduct formation in this case. Density functional theory calculations show that adduct formation between boranes and the conjugated molecules and segments of the polymers is energetically favorable and that some charge transfer between adducts and neutral polymers is plausible if Coulombic and entropic effects are taken into consideration. Thus, such adducts can be considered as possible doping sites for conjugated polymers.","Mukhopadhyaya, Tushita; Lee, Taein; Ganley, Connor; Clancy, Paulette; Katz, Howard E., 2022, ""Data associated with the publication: Evidence of pre-formed Lewis acid-base and Wheland-type complexes acting as dopants for p-type conjugated polymers"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/8OFLMF"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/8OFLMF</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2022-06-17T19:59:53Z","Dr. Howard Katz NSF-supported projects","Mukhopadhyaya, Tushita; Lee, Taein; Ganley, Connor; Clancy, Paulette; Katz, Howard E., 2022, ""Data associated with the publication: Evidence of pre-formed Lewis acid-base and Wheland-type complexes acting as dopants for p-type conjugated polymers"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/8OFLMF, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",4

However the extent to which proxy decision-makers are engaged in decisions about their patient’s care is challenging to quantify. Objectives: To assess 1) whether proxies know their patient’s actual code status as recorded in the electronic medical record (EMR), and 2) whether code status orders reflect ICU patient preferences as reported by proxy decision-makers. Methods: We interviewed proxy decision-makers for 111 consecutively admitted adult ICU patients. Proxies were asked about the patient’s goals of care, preferred code status, and actual code status. Responses were compared to code status orders in the EMR at the time of interview. Characteristics of patients and proxies who correctly vs incorrectly identified actual code status were compared, as were characteristics of proxies who reported a preferred code status that did vs did not match actual code status. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 42 proxies (36%) were incorrect or unsure about the patient’s actual code status and those who were correct vs. incorrect or unsure were similar in age, race, and years of education (P>0.20 for all comparisons). Thirty-five proxies (29%) reported a preferred code status that did not match the patient’s code status in the EMR. Matching preferred and actual code status was not associated with a patient’s age, gender, income, admission diagnosis, or subsequent in-hospital mortality or with proxy age, gender, race, education level, or relation to the patient (P>0.20 for all comparisons). Conclusions: More than 1 in 3 proxies is incorrect or unsure about their patient’s actual code status and more than 1 in 4 proxies reported that a preferred code status that did not match orders in the EMR.

The optimized formulation exhibits a power factor of up to 5.3 uW K-2 m-1, about nine times higher than the highest power factor we achieved from mixtures of only P3HT and F4TCNQ. The Bi2Te3 was responsible for increases in both Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. P3HT, with higher hole mobility, was superior to PQT12 (poly(bisdodecylquaterthiophene), and F4TCNQ was at least as good as FeCl3, for matrix and dopant, respectively, for this purpose. The power factor obtained is about 40% of that reportedly obtained from synthesized Bi2Te3 nanowires in FeCl3-doped P3HT. We calculated the expected contributions of bulk Bi2Te3 to the composite conductivity and then examined the resistance caused by interfaces on four different size distributions of Bi2Te3 particles, as well as a solid macroscopic ingot. A nonlinear I-V relationship was found for the doped P3HT-ingot bilayer. While our doped conjugated polymer system made only from commercial-grade components was shown to support the extraction of thermoelectric performance by a commonly used inorganic semiconductor, our results also suggest that an advantage of the smallest Bi2Te3 domains, including nanowires, may arise from their having less interfacial resistance than larger Bi2Te3 particles and pieces.","Huang, Jiyuan; Li, Hui; Hoffman, Christina; Katz, Howard, 2019, ""Data associated with publication &quot;Contributions to Composite Conductivity and Seebeck Coefficient in Commercial Bi2Te3 &ndash; Conjugated Polymer Composites&quot;"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/KV9KNX"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/KV9KNX</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2019-04-08T18:51:56Z","Dr. Howard Katz NSF-supported projects","Huang, Jiyuan; Li, Hui; Hoffman, Christina; Katz, Howard, 2019, ""Data associated with publication ""Contributions to Composite Conductivity and Seebeck Coefficient in Commercial Bi2Te3 – Conjugated Polymer Composites"""", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/KV9KNX, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",7

We used a literature-informed strategy to develop the Consumerist Attitudes towards Healthcare Scale, drawing items from related scales if these items represented the construct of consumerism. We conducted a targeted literature search to identify conceptual models that describe the patient as a consumer of healthcare. We also identified existing scales and questionnaires as a supply of items for inclusion. From the identified literature, we extracted a list of attitudes, preferences, and expectations for inclusion in our initial survey. We surveyed a nationally representative US population with a 45 item questionnaire that used 5-point Likert responses to assess consumeristic attitudes. We generated a polychoric correlation matrix and did exploratory factor analysis using a principal components solution. We sent the resulting scale to additional respondents twice for repeatability testing. We then surveyed a new nationally representative population with this consumeristic attitudes scale plus 2 additional existent scales for testing of concordance and discordance. The confirmatory factor analysis on the new results was very similar to the initial survey results supporting a 3-factor, 11 item scale. The three factors might best be described as 1) feeling self-efficacious in health care interactions; 2) preferring to be the decision maker; 3) expressing confidence in knowledge about the health care system. On a five point scale (with 1 being most consumeristic), the respondents had mean score of 1.9 (SD 0.53).The scale was correlated modestly with the Medical Maximizer/Minimizer Scale (rho=0.25, p<0.0001) and was not correlated with the Attitudes toward Technology Scale (rho=0.07, p=0.17), which is what we anticipated.

The audiotaped transcripts were professionally transcribed verbatim. We used a combination of conventional and directed approaches for qualitative content analysis. We found that nearly all expressed that they or an acquaintance had experienced some overtesting or overtreatment, expressing agreement that terms such as “unnecessary,” “wasteful” and “overdoing it” characterized these encounters. Major themes that were expressed as contributing to overuse were: (1) poor quality of communication between patients and doctors; (2) treating individual complaints instead of “the whole person”; (3) few efforts to engage patients in shared decision-making; (4) inadequate communication between different health care providers involved in a patient’s care; and (5) little trust in the clinician. Yet, many participants also expressed concern that they had received too little care.

Empowering families to make informed decisions about their loved one’s care is important, but it is unclear how best to communicate prognostic information to vulnerable surrogates when a patient is expected to die. Objective: To test the hypothesis that family members interpret intensivists as being more optimistic when their questions about prognosis are answered indirectly. Design: Between September 27 and October 17, 2019 we conducted a web-based randomized trial of video vignettes depicting an intensivist answering a standardized question about the prognosis of a patient at high risk for death on ICU day 3. Setting: Web-based simulation Participants: National sample of adult children, spouses/partners, or siblings of patients with COPD on long term oxygen therapy. Participants were excluded if they had worked as a doctor, nurse, or advanced practice provider. Intervention: Participants were randomized to view one of 4 intensivist communication styles in response to the question “What do you think is most likely to happen?”: 1) a direct response (control), 2) an indirect response comparing the patient’s condition to other patients, 3) an indirect response describing physiology, or 4) redirection to a discussion of patient values and goals. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participant responses to two questions: 1) “If you had to guess, what do you think the doctor thinks is the chance that your loved one will survive this hospitalization?” and 2) “What do you think are the chances that your loved one will survive this hospitalization?” answered using a 0%-100% probability scale. Results: 302 participants completed the trial, of whom 204 (68%) were female and 165 (55%) were adult children of the patient.

The introduction of spacer subunits to separate the side chains improves the accommodation of dopant molecules close to the polymer backbone. Therefore, the lamellar structure and π–π stacking of polymers were negligibly disturbed by dopants; in fact, improved ordering and closer π-stacking were observed after chemical doping.

The conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are measured before and after charging. We find that the conductivity increases significantly, while the Seebeck coefficient decreases correspondingly in a trend of S ∝ ln(σ) after the dielectrics were negatively charged, resulting in an average of 5-fold increase in power factor at the maximum charging level. Additionally, temperature-dependent conductivity measurements show that the activation energy decreases with the increasing conductivity. We calculate the Seebeck coefficient based on the activation energy and find the result is consistent with the Mott mobility edge model.

One difficulty is how to interpret the linear depth profiles of dissolved Cu in the ocean. Additionally, the relationships between Cu and macronutrients in the global ocean have not been well characterized. Examining the relationships between observed Cu, PO43–, and Si, we found that Cu was more correlated with Si than PO43– in the global ocean. In our model, both biogeochemical cycling and internal circulation are important for explaining global marine Cu distributions. Our modeling results suggest a deep remineralization of Cu, which is consistent with previous lab results. Furthermore, the modeling results indicate that the uptake of Cu in the Southern Ocean is substantially higher than that in non-Southern Oceans. These results lead us to hypothesize that phytoplankton such as diatoms living in the Southern Ocean dominate marine Cu distributions.","Cui, Minming; Gnanadesikan, Anand, 2021, ""Data associated with the publication: Characterizing the roles of biogeochemical cycling and ocean circulation in regulating marine copper distributions"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/BNSVVD"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/BNSVVD</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2021-12-30T19:26:56Z","Earth System Modeling at Johns Hopkins","Cui, Minming; Gnanadesikan, Anand, 2021, ""Data associated with the publication: Characterizing the roles of biogeochemical cycling and ocean circulation in regulating marine copper distributions"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/BNSVVD, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",10

From the abstract: The nature of and the ability to control biasing across dielectrics is a key area of research for the design of more versatile organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). One important technique to achieve such control is the inclusion of donor or acceptor molecules in the dielectric to modulate charge trapping therein. In this work, we report the effects of the additive concentration on OFETs with two different arylamines blended in polystyrene (PS) dielectrics, N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-di-p-tolylbenzene-1,4-diamine (MPDA) and 4-anilinotriphenylamine (PATPA), as well as a comparison between PATPA/PS blends and dielectrics where PATPA was chemically tethered to the PS matrix. Dielectrics included in OFETs were subject to charging, and their charging capacity and stability were extracted from the OFET threshold voltages. For both MPDA/PS and PATPA/PS, blends with additive mole fractions as low as χ = 3 × 10–4 were sufficient to cause increases in the charge trapping relative to pure PS dielectrics. We observed a pronounced inverse relationship between the capacity and stability of blended systems at larger mole fractions (χ = 10–2) where the interadditive molecule distances became comparable to their size (∼1 nm). Differences between MPDA and PATPA behaviors were consistent with their different structures and sizes. Furthermore, we found a small effect on electronic trapping arising from the chemical tethering of PATPA to the PS matrix. This result was consistent with the changes made to the additive during the tethering process and small compared to the observed differences arising from the concentration. These results suggest that the average intermolecular separation is a key determinant of charge storage stability in blended dielectrics.","Plunkett, Evan C.; Zhang, Qingyang; Katz, Howard E.; Reich, Daniel H., 2021, ""Data associated with the publication: Charge trapping in polymer electrets with highly dilute blended arylamine donors"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/BT02SS"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/BT02SS</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2021-07-19T20:18:07Z","Dr. Howard Katz DOE-supported projects","Plunkett, Evan C.; Zhang, Qingyang; Katz, Howard E.; Reich, Daniel H., 2021, ""Data associated with the publication: Charge trapping in polymer electrets with highly dilute blended arylamine donors"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/BT02SS, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",5

The influence of these groups on dielectric function, charge retention and threshold voltage shifts (ΔVth) depending on their positions in dielectric multilayers was determined. We compared the observations made on an N-perphenylated iminobisaniline side chain with those from the same side chains modified with ZnO nanoparticles and with an adduct formed from tetracyanoethylene (TCNE). We also synthesized an analogue in which six methoxy groups are present instead of two amine nitrogens. At 6 mol % side chain, hopping transport was sufficient to cause shorting of the gate, while at 2 mol %, charge trapping was observable as transistor threshold voltage shifts (ΔVth). We created three types of devices: with the substituted PS layer as single layer dielectric, on top of a crosslinked PS layer but in contact with the pentacene (bilayers), and sandwiched between two PS layers in trilayers. Particularly large bias stress effects and ΔVth, larger than the hexamethoxy and previously studied dimethoxy analogs, were observed in the second case and the effects increased with the increasing electron donating properties of the modified side chains. The highest ΔVth was consistent with a majority of the side chains stabilizing trapped charge. Trilayer devices showed decreased charge storage capability compared to previous work in which we used less donating side chains but in higher concentrations. The ZnO and TCNE modifications resulted in slightly more and less negative ΔVth, respectively, when the side chain polystyrene was not in contact with the pentacene and isolated from the gate electrode. The results indicate a likely maximum combination of molecular charge stabilizing activity and side chain concentration that still allows gate dielectric function.","Zhang, Qingyang; Barrett, Brandon; Lee, Taein; Mukhopadhyaya, Tushita; Lu, Chengchangfeng; Plunkett, Evan C.; Kale, Tejaswini; Chi, Chen; Livi, Kenneth J.T.; McGuiggan, Patricia; Reich, Daniel H.; Thon, Susanna; Bragg, Arthur E.; Katz, Howard E., 2021, ""Data associated with publication: Maximized hole trapping in a polystyrene transistor dielectric from a highly branched iminobis (aminoarene) side chain"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/VCPZIK"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/VCPZIK</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2021-08-05T21:44:39Z","Dr. Howard Katz DOE-supported projects","Zhang, Qingyang; Barrett, Brandon; Lee, Taein; Mukhopadhyaya, Tushita; Lu, Chengchangfeng; Plunkett, Evan C.; Kale, Tejaswini; Chi, Chen; Livi, Kenneth J.T.; McGuiggan, Patricia; Reich, Daniel H.; Thon, Susanna; Bragg, Arthur E.; Katz, Howard E., 2021, ""Data associated with publication: Maximized hole trapping in a polystyrene transistor dielectric from a highly branched iminobis (aminoarene) side chain"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/VCPZIK, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",7

Typically, this variability is treated as noise, and assumed to cancel out, leaving supposedly stable relationships among behavior, neural activity, and experimental task conditions. Those relationships, however, could change with a participant’s internal cognitive states, and variability in performance may carry important information regarding those states, which cannot be directly measured. Therefore, we used a mathematical, state-space modeling framework to fit internal cognitive states to measured behavioral data, quantifying each participant’s sensitivity to factors such as past errors or distractions, to characterize their underlying fluctuations in reaction time. We show how integrating the states into the modeling framework could help explain trial-by-trial variability in behavior. Further, we identify EEG functional connectivity features that modulate with each state. These results illustrate the potential of this approach and how it could enable the quantification of intra- and inter-individual differences and provide insight into their neural bases.

We studied area V2 neurons in behaving macaques with static images of complex natural scenes. We found that about half of the neurons were border-ownership selective for contours in natural scenes and this selectivity originated from the image context. The border-ownership signals emerged within 70 ms after stimulus onset, only ~ 30 ms after response onset. A substantial fraction of neurons were highly consistent across scenes.

Therapeutic options for managing preterm birth are generally unavailable for 98% of the almost 15 million preterm babies born each year, and the evidence base for preventative interventions is lacking. One area that has been substantially neglected in developing countries is the role that poor oral health may play raising the likelihood of early spontaneous delivery. There is epidemiologic and microbiologic evidence for an association between maternal periodontal disease and preterm birth, however, causal mechanisms are not fully understood, and results from randomized trials intervening on mothers with periodontal therapies to reduce prematurity have been mixed. In 2014, we initiated a community-based project to examine this question in a high burden setting with low levels of confounding risk factors. Sarlahi District in southern Nepal fit this description, with high rates of neonatal mortality (28 / 1,000 live births), preterm birth (17%), low birth weight (30%), poor oral health, and low rates of smoking, alcohol use, and chronic diseases. The overall objective of our study was to assess the epidemiologic relationship between periodontal disease and preterm birth and investigate causal mechanisms on the pathway from oral infection to early spontaneous delivery. Our specific aims included the following: 1. Assess the incidence of preterm birth among women with / without periodontitis 2. Examine relationships between causal mechanisms, specifically clinical signs of periodontitis, subgingival biofilm composition, and levels of inflammatory mediators in gingival crevicular fluid and serum 3. Conduct a small pilot trial to estimate the association between adherence to a 0.12% chlorhexidine (non-alcohol) daily mouthrinse and subgingival biofilm composition and levels of inflammatory mediators in gingival crevicular fluid and serum 4.

Data (Part 1) consists of compilation of semiconductor characteristics of polymers without gas exposure and with gas exposure (concentration range of ammonia and nitrogen dioxide). In addition, raw data for remote gate sensing are included. In Data (Part 2), 4 point conductivity measurements, GPC, XPS, and processed data compilations and figures are included. From the article abstract: A carboxylated thiophene polymer-based chemiresistive device in a field-effect transistor (FET) configuration with unusual and enhanced responses to the widespread pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ammonia (NH3) is described. The device based on a polymeric thiophene carboxylic acid showed a dramatic and superlinear increase in drain current (ID) of over 15000% to a ramped exposure to 10 ppm NO2 over several minutes, while its ethyl ester counterpart had significantly lower response. Devices incorporating either an ester or carboxylic acid displayed comparable and previously unreported increases in (ID from 10 ppm ramped NH3 exposure of 200–300%. Conventional poly(alkylthiophenes) showed the expected current decreases from similar NH3 exposures. Using threshold voltage shifts in silicon transistors coupled to our recently reported remote gate (RG) platform with thiophene polymer coatings, we determined that two differing response mechanisms are associated with the two gas exposures. By calculating the charge density induced in the polymers by NO2 exposure using the silicon transistor voltage shifts, we conclude that proton conduction contributes significantly to the high sensitivity of the carboxylic acid to NO2, in addition to doping that was observed for all four polymers. Furthermore, hydrogen bonding moieties of the carboxylic acid and ester may be able to physisorb NH3 and thus alter the charge distribution, rearrange polymer chains, and/or create a proton transfer network leading to the ID increase that is the opposite of the response obtained from non-carboxylated thiophene polymers.","Wagner, Justine; Jang, Hyun June; Han, Jinfeng; Katz, Howard E., 2021, ""Data associated with publication: Enhanced and unconventional responses in chemiresistive sensing devices for nitrogen dioxide and ammonia from carboxylated alkylthiophene polymers"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/M4FJUL"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/M4FJUL</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2021-03-18T15:19:14Z","Dr. Howard Katz NSF-supported projects","Wagner, Justine; Jang, Hyun June; Han, Jinfeng; Katz, Howard E., 2021, ""Data associated with publication: Enhanced and unconventional responses in chemiresistive sensing devices for nitrogen dioxide and ammonia from carboxylated alkylthiophene polymers"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/M4FJUL, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",10

Proper interpretation of such relationships can be made complex, however, if the ln(C)~ln(Q) relationships are nonlinear or if the relationships change over time, season, or discharge. Methods of addressing these issues by ‘binning’ data can introduce artifacts that obscure underlying interactions among time, discharge, and season. Here we illustrate these issues and propose an alternative method that uses the regression coefficients of the recently-developed WRTDS (‘Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season’) model for examining (C-Q) relationships in long-term, discretely-sampled data for various water-quality constituents, including their uncertainties. The method is applied to sediment concentration data from Susquehanna River at Conowingo Dam, Maryland to illustrate how the coefficients can be accessed and presented in ways that provide additional insights toward the interpretation of river water-quality data, which reaffirms the recently-documented decadal-scale decline in reservoir trapping performance.","Zhang, Qian; Harman, Ciaran J.; Ball, William P., 2016, ""Data associated with An Improved Method for Interpretation of Riverine Concentration-Discharge Relationships Indicates Long-Term Shifts in Reservoir Sediment Trapping"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T18G8HM0"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T18G8HM0</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V6","2023-06-08T12:11:46Z","Retrospective Analysis of Nutrient and Sediment Loadings to the Chesapeake Bay: Exploration of Trends and Affecting Factors","Zhang, Qian; Harman, Ciaran J.; Ball, William P., 2016, ""Data associated with An Improved Method for Interpretation of Riverine Concentration-Discharge Relationships Indicates Long-Term Shifts in Reservoir Sediment Trapping"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T18G8HM0, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V6",37

From the publication abstract: Animal nervous systems resolve sensory conflict for the control of movement. For example, the glass knifefish, Eigenmannia virescens, relies on visual and electrosensory feedback as it swims to maintain position within a moving refuge. To study how signals from these two parallel sensory streams are used in refuge tracking, we constructed a novel augmented reality apparatus that enables the independent manipulation of visual and electrosensory cues to freely swimming fish (N=5). We evaluated the linearity of multisensory integration, the change to the relative perceptual weights given to vision an d electrosense in relation to sensory salience, and the effect of the magnitude of sensory conflict on sensorimotor gain. First, we found that tracking behaviour obeys superposition of the sensory inputs, suggesting linear sensorimotor integration. In addition, fish rely more on vision when electrosensory salience is reduced, suggesting that fish dynamically alter sensorimotor gains in a manner consistent with Bayesian integration. However, the magnitude of sensory conflict did not significantly affect sensorimotor gain. These studies lay the theoretical and experimental groundwork for future work investigating multisensory control of locomotion.","Sutton, Erin E.; Demir, Alican; Stamper, Sarah A.; Fortune, Eric S.; Cowan, Noah J., 2016, ""Data associated with publication &quot;Dynamic modulation of visual and electrosensory gains for locomotor control&quot;"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1D798BQ"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1D798BQ</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V3","2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","JHU LIMBS Laboratory Data Archive","Sutton, Erin E.; Demir, Alican; Stamper, Sarah A.; Fortune, Eric S.; Cowan, Noah J., 2016, ""Data associated with publication ""Dynamic modulation of visual and electrosensory gains for locomotor control"""", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1D798BQ, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V3",66

Five adults with severe autism were tested in a repeated-measures design with two tasks. High-frequency ‘known’ words (e.g. bus, airplane) and low-frequency ‘unknown’ words (e.g. ackee, cherimoya) were presented in a visual-world task (during which EM and PD data were collected) and a picture-word congruity task (during which ERP data were collected). Using a case study approach with single-subject analyses, we demonstrate that these implicit measures can provide estimates of receptive vocabulary knowledge in the majority of these participants. However, participants differed with respect to which measures were the most sensitive and which variables best predicted vocabulary knowledge.

Background: Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) programs have expanded rapidly, but evaluating their impact on hospital care is challenging. Objectives: To demonstrate how careful study design can reveal POLST’s impact at hospital admission and why analyses of state registry data are unlikely to capture POLST’s effects. Design: Prospective cohort study Setting and Participants: Adult in-patients with Do Not Intubate and/or Do Not Resuscitate (DNR/I) orders in the electronic medical record at the time of discharge from Johns Hopkins Hospital over 18 months. For patients with unplanned readmissions within 30 days, records were reviewed to determine if a Maryland Medical Order for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) form was presented and for the time from readmission to a DNR/I order in the EMR. Analyses were stratified by whether patients could communicate or were accompanied by a proxy at readmission. Results: Among 1,507 patients with DNR/I orders at discharge, 124 (8%) had unplanned readmissions, 112 (90%) could communicate or were accompanied by a proxy at readmission, and 12 (10%) could not communicate and were unaccompanied. For patients who were unaccompanied and could not communicate, MOLST significantly decreased the median time from readmission to DNR/I order (1.2 vs 27.1 hours, P=.001), but this association was greatly attenuated among patients who could communicate or were accompanied by a proxy (16.4 vs 25.4 hours P=.10). Conclusion: Among patients who wanted to avoid intubation and/or CPR, MOLST forms were protective when the patient was unaccompanied by a healthcare proxy at admission and could not communicate. Fewer than 10% of patients met these criteria during unplanned readmissions, and state registry data does not allow this sub-population to be identified.","Turnbull, Alison E.; Ning, Xuejuan; Rao, Anirudh; Tao, Jessica J.; Needham, Dale M., 2019, ""Data association with the publication entitled: 'Demonstrating the Impact of POLST Forms on Hospital Care Requires Information not Contained in State Registries'"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/LJZQPI"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/LJZQPI</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V2","2019-06-21T13:53:21Z","PIPER group - MOLST research","Turnbull, Alison E.; Ning, Xuejuan; Rao, Anirudh; Tao, Jessica J.; Needham, Dale M., 2019, ""Data association with the publication entitled: 'Demonstrating the Impact of POLST Forms on Hospital Care Requires Information not Contained in State Registries'"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/LJZQPI, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V2",14

Bubbles adsorb and transport particulate matter both in industrial and marine systems. While methane-containing bubbles emitted from anoxic sediments are found extensively in aquatic ecosystems, relatively little attention has been paid to the possibility that such bubbles transport particle-associated chemical or biological material from sediments to surface waters of freshwater lakes. We quantified transport of particulate material from sediments to the surface by bubbles in Upper Mystic Lake, MA and in a 15 m tall experimental column. Vertical particle transport was positively correlated with the volume of gas bubbles released from the sediment. Particles transported by bubbles originated almost entirely in the sediment, rather than being scavenged from the water column. Concentrations of arsenic, chromium, lead, and cyanobacterial cells in bubble-transported particulate material were similar to those of bulk sediment, and particles were transported from depths exceeding 15 m, resulting in daily fluxes as large as 0.18 µg of arsenic m-2 and 2 x 104 cyanobacterial cells m-2 in the strongly stratified Upper Mystic Lake. While bubble-facilitated arsenic transport currently appears to be a modest component of total arsenic cycling in this lake, bubble-facilitated cyanobacterial transport could comprise as much as 17% of recruitment in this lake and may thus be of particular importance in large, deep, stratified lakes.","Delwiche, Kyle; Gu, Junyao; Hemond, Harold; Preheim, Sarah, 2019, ""Data Associated with publication &quot;Vertical transport of sediment-associated metals and cyanobacteria by ebullition in a stratified lake&quot;"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/7WXPIN"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/7WXPIN</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2019-10-08T13:57:17Z","Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository","Delwiche, Kyle; Gu, Junyao; Hemond, Harold; Preheim, Sarah, 2019, ""Data Associated with publication ""Vertical transport of sediment-associated metals and cyanobacteria by ebullition in a stratified lake"""", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/7WXPIN, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",29

Here we introduce a guidance system inspired by electric fish that incorporates measurements from a newly designed electrogenic sensory catheter with preoperative imaging to provide continuous feedback to guide vascular procedures without additional contrast injection, radiation, image registration, or external tracking. Electrodes near the catheter tip simultaneously create a weak electric field and measure the impedance, which changes with the internal geometry of the vessel as the catheter advances through the vasculature. The impedance time series is then mapped to a preoperative vessel model to determine the relative position of the catheter within the vessel tree. We present navigation in a synthetic vessel tree based on our mapping technique. Experiments in a porcine model demonstrated the sensor’s ability to detect cross-sectional area variation in vivo.

Biofilms that colonize filter media during normal function can significantly alter performance, but it is not clear how characteristics of individual populations colonizing porous media combine to affect bacterial retention. We assess how four bacterial strains isolated from stormwater and a laboratory strain, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, alter Escherichia coli retention in experimental sand columns under conditions of stormwater filtration relative to a clean-bed control. Our results demonstrate that these strains differentially affect E. coli retention, as was previously shown for a model colloid. To determine whether E. coli retention could be influenced by changes in relative abundance of strains within a microbial community, we selected two pairs of biofilm strains with the largest observed differences in E. coli retention and tested how changes in relative abundance of strain pairs in the biofilm affected E. coli retention. The results demonstrate that E. coli retention efficiency is influenced by the retention characteristics of the strains within biofilm microbial community, but individual strain characteristics influence retention in a manner that cannot be determined from changes in their relative abundance alone. This study demonstrates that changes in the relative abundance of specific members of a biofilm community can significantly alter filter performance, but these changes are not a simple function of strain-specific retention and the relative abundance. Our results suggest that the microbial community composition of biofilms should be considered when evaluating factors that influence filter performance.","Zhang, Yue; He, Yan; Sakowski, Eric G.; Preheim, Sarah P., 2021, ""Data associated with the publication: Influence of simplified microbial community biofilms on bacterial retention in porous media under conditions of stormwater biofiltration"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/ZPJZJC"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/ZPJZJC</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2021-10-13T12:17:00Z","Dr. Sarah Preheim's Lab Publication Datasets","Zhang, Yue; He, Yan; Sakowski, Eric G.; Preheim, Sarah P., 2021, ""Data associated with the publication: Influence of simplified microbial community biofilms on bacterial retention in porous media under conditions of stormwater biofiltration"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/ZPJZJC, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",10

It also contains molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of WT Hfq. From the abstract: RNA-binding proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions whose functions in RNA recognition are poorly understood. The RNA chaperone Hfq is a homohexamer that contains six flexible C-terminal domains (CTDs). The effect of the CTDs on Hfq’s integrity and RNA binding has been challenging to study because of their sequence identity and inherent disorder. We used native mass spectrometry coupled with surface-induced dissociation and molecular dynamics simulations to disentangle the arrangement of the CTDs and their impact on the stability of Escherichia coli Hfq with and without RNA. The results show that the CTDs stabilize the Hfq hexamer through multiple interactions with the core and between CTDs. RNA binding perturbs this network of CTD interactions, destabilizing the Hfq ring. This destabilization is partially compensated by binding of RNAs that contact multiple surfaces of Hfq. By contrast, binding of short RNAs that only contact one or two subunits results in net destabilization of the complex. Together, the results show that a network of intrinsically disordered interactions integrate RNA contacts with the six subunits of Hfq. We propose that this CTD network raises the selectivity of RNA binding.","Sarni, Samantha H.; Roca, Jorjethe; Du, Chen; Jia, Mengxuan; Li, Hantian; Damjanovic, Ana; Małecka, Ewelina M.; Wysocki, Vicki H.; Woodson, Sarah A., 2022, ""Data associated with the publication: Intrinsically disordered interaction network in an RNA chaperone revealed by native mass spectrometry"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/RTSGO0"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/RTSGO0</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2022-11-15T14:01:46Z","JHU Woodson Laboratory Data Archive","Sarni, Samantha H.; Roca, Jorjethe; Du, Chen; Jia, Mengxuan; Li, Hantian; Damjanovic, Ana; Małecka, Ewelina M.; Wysocki, Vicki H.; Woodson, Sarah A., 2022, ""Data associated with the publication: Intrinsically disordered interaction network in an RNA chaperone revealed by native mass spectrometry"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/RTSGO0, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",29

We used these analyses to study the effects of seasonal oxygen decline and biological turnover on pyrite burial rates and pyrite sulfur isotope compositions. Pyrite burial in marine and estuarine sediments is a key process that impacts oxygen levels in the ocean-atmosphere system over geological timescales. Pyrite’s sulfur isotope composition can also be used to study ancient environmental conditions. We found that at both studied sites, pyrite primarily forms in the summer and dissolves in the winter. The more frequently ventilated site had higher pyrite concentrations because of higher rates of formation in the summer, which may be influenced by sulfur oxidizing microbial communities. Despite differences in rates of pyrite formation between sites, sulfur isotope ratios (34S/32S) of pyrite are similar between the sites and are lower than the 34S/32S ratios of coexisting pyrite precursors. This offset between pyrite sulfur isotopes and pyrite precursors may be due to position-specific isotope effects. Here, we include the following data that support these results: 1) Solid phase sulfur and carbon isotope geochemistry for sediment samples from Chesapeake Bay Sites CB4.3C and CB4.3W, 2) Radiogenic isotope data (Pb-210, Ra-226, Cs-137, Be-7) for sediment samples from Chesapeake Bay Sites CB4.3C and CB4.3W, 3) Matlab code for the position-specific isotope effect model.","Hantsoo, Kalev G.; Gomes, Maya L.; Malkin, Sairah Y.; Brenner, Dana C.; Kenney, William F., 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: Sedimentary pyrite formation in a seasonally oxygen-stressed estuary: potential imprints of microbial ecology and position-specific isotope fractionation"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/EHSEV2"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/EHSEV2</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1, UNF:6:DK7dz3sVEQVVZ6WRwa3dkA== [fileUNF]","2023-04-03T14:00:46Z","Sedimentary Geobiology Group","Hantsoo, Kalev G.; Gomes, Maya L.; Malkin, Sairah Y.; Brenner, Dana C.; Kenney, William F., 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: Sedimentary pyrite formation in a seasonally oxygen-stressed estuary: potential imprints of microbial ecology and position-specific isotope fractionation"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/EHSEV2, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1, UNF:6:DK7dz3sVEQVVZ6WRwa3dkA== [fileUNF]",9

These processes require that EPCs break down the extracellular matrix (ECM), migrate, differentiate and undergo tube morphogenesis. Evidently, the ECM plays a critical role by providing biochemical and biophysical cues that regulate cellular behaviour. Using a chemically and mechanically tunable hydrogel to study tube morphogenesis in vitro, we show that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and substrate mechanics co-regulate tubulogenesis of EPCs. High levels of VEGF are required to initiate tube morphogenesis and activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which enable EPC migration. Under these conditions, the elasticity of the substrate affects the progression of tube morphogenesis. With decreases in substrate stiffness, we observe decreased MMP expression while increased cellular elongation, with intracel lular vacuole extension and coalescence to open lumen compartments. RNAi studies demonstrate that membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP) is required to enable the movement of EPCs on the matrix and that EPCs sense matrix stiffness through signalling cascades leading to the activation of the RhoGTPase Cdc42.

Moreover, control over the formation of organized vascular networks in vitro may facilitate their rapid and functional integration with the host vasculature after implantation. The extracellular matrix provides a structural platform for endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to differentiate and assemble into a tubular structure. We demonstrate that optimized, patterned fibronectin surfaces guide the ordered adhesion of human EPCs, maintain EPC responsiveness to tumor necrosis factor-α, support their elongation along the culture period, and enhance vo n Willebrand factor expression. Using fibrin gel as the three-dimensional milieu allows the assembly of unidirectional chains and formation of tubular structures. High-resolution analysis shows a distinctive lumen, as well as numerous Weibel Palade bodies and caveolae, all indicating a typical progression in vascular morphogenesis and the angiogenic process.

Evaluations of loads by season revealed N, P, and SS load magnitudes have been highest in January-March and lowest in July-September, but the temporal trends have followed similar decadal-scale patterns in all seasons, with notable exceptions. Generally, total N (TN) load has dropped since the late 1980s, but particulate nutrients and SS have risen since the mid-1990s. The majority of these rises were from Susquehanna River and relate to diminished net trapping at the Conowingo Reservoir. Substantial rises in SS were also observed, however, in other rivers. Moreover, the summed rise in particulate P load from other rivers is of similar magnitude as from Susquehanna. Dissolved nutrient loads have dropped in the upland (Piedmont and above) rivers, but risen in two small rivers in the Coastal Plain affected by lagged groundwater input. In addition, analysis of fractional contributions revealed consistent N trends across the upland watersheds. Finally, total N:total P ratios have declined in most rivers, suggesting the potential for changes in nutrient limitation. Overall, this integrated study of historical data highlights the value of maintaining long-term monitoring at multiple watershed locations.","Zhang, Qian; Ball, William P., 2014, ""Data associated with the publication: Long-term trends of nutrients and sediment from the nontidal Chesapeake watershed: an assessment of progress by river and season"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1VD6WC7"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1VD6WC7</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V11","2016-04-12T00:00:00Z","Retrospective Analysis of Nutrient and Sediment Loadings to the Chesapeake Bay: Exploration of Trends and Affecting Factors","Zhang, Qian; Ball, William P., 2014, ""Data associated with the publication: Long-term trends of nutrients and sediment from the nontidal Chesapeake watershed: an assessment of progress by river and season"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1VD6WC7, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V11",62

Here we present a comprehensive evaluation of nutrient and sediment loads over the last three decades at multiple locations in the Susquehanna River basin (SRB), Chesapeake's largest tributary watershed. Sediment and nutrient riverine loadings, including both dissolved and particulate fractions, have generally declined at all sites upstream of Conowingo Dam (non-tidal SRB outlet). Period-of-record declines in riverine yield are generally smaller than those in source input, suggesting the possibility of legacy contributions. Consistent with other watershed studies, these results reinforce the importance of considering lag time between the implementation of management actions and achievement of river quality improvement. Whereas flow-normalized loadings for particulate species have increased recently below Conowingo Reservoir, those for upstream sites have declined, thus substantiating conclusions from prior studies about decreased reservoir trapping efficiency. In regard to streamflow effects, statistically significant log-linear relationships between annual streamflow and annual constituent load suggest the dominance of hydrological control on the inter-annual variability of constituent export. Concentration-discharge relationships revealed general chemostasis and mobilization effects for dissolved and particulate species, respectively, both suggesting transport-limitation conditions. In addition to affecting annual export rates, streamflow has also modulated the relative importance of dissolved and particulate fractions, as reflected by its negative correlations with dissolved P/total P, dissolved N/total N, particulate P/SS, and total N/total P ratios. For land-use effects, period-of-record median annual yields of N, P, and SS all correlate positively with the area fraction of non-forested land but negatively with that of forested land under all hydrological conditions. Overall, this work has informed understanding with respect to four major factors affecting constituent export (i.e., source input, reservoir modulation, streamflow, and land use) and demonstrated the value of long-term river monitoring.

The broader goal was guide policy and program interventions that may influence household food security, poverty, and the diets, health and nutrition of pre-school children and their mothers. The PoSHAN surveys were conducted in a total of 21 sub-district units or Village Development Committees (VDCs), each in a unique district. The VDCs in PoSHAN form a nationally representative sample, stratified by the agroecological zones of Mountains, Hills and Terai (plains) with each zone containing 7 VDCs. Further, each VDC consisted of a set of 3 wards, adding up to a total of 63 wards in the full sample. The PoSHAN surveys were conducted in the same season and site every year, with seasonal (sentinel) surveys conducted every 3 months during the first two years of the survey. Eligible households included in the survey consisted of households that either had at least one child under 5 years or a newly-married woman (married within the past 2 years). The annual surveys were conducted in all 21 VDCs with data collected using a total of 10 types of forms that collected information at the community, market, household and individual levels.

In collaboration with the national Department of Fomento, or Development, they proposed and revised a table requesting information on agricultural activity across the country by property. Asserting that the Statistical Office already had much information to hand, Fomento officials removed numerous columns from the proposed table. They then circulated the resultant survey to every municipal president in Mexico in summer 1899. This dataset is built on transcriptions of the tables returned by municipal and state officials. It represents about 1,400 municipalities from 18 states and territories. The EstadisticaAgricola1899_AllData file includes all the transcribed data at the property level. The EstadisticaAgricola1899_SummaryStatistics file includes data summarized at the municipal level. The tables were transcribed as directly as possible, with the Annotation column containing any writing from outside the table itself. Transcriber notes regarding decisions made, illegible content, etc., is included in the Summary Statistics table, as is information on who signed the table and when they signed it. If information was written vertically across an entire column for a town, that information has been copied into the appropriate cell for each property within that town. Transcribers used their best judgment with regards to ditto marks versus indications that there was no information to include in a particular cell, as enumerators’ use of symbols to denote the two distinct options often looked similar. The codebook for each table contains additional information about how names, units of measure, and other information was standardized. It is important to note that enumerators responded to the table in very different ways. The data in this dataset is not commensurate and care must be taken in drawing comparisons beyond the municipal level. Lacking clear instructions, officials made different decisions about what kind of properties to include, how to note yield, whether to include information at the municipal or property level, and so on.

Until 2020, two genetic lineages of influenza B virus – Yamagata and Victoria – circulated in the population. These lineages are antigenically distinct but differences in virus replication or the induction of host cell responses after infection have not been carefully studied. Recent IBV clinical isolates of both lineages were obtained from influenza surveillance efforts of the Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence in Influenza Research and Response and characterized in vitro. B/Victoria and B/Yamagata clinical isolates were recognized less efficiently by serum from influenza-vaccinated individuals in comparison to the vaccine strains. B/Victoria lineages formed smaller plaques on MDCK cells compared to B/Yamagata, but infectious virus production in primary human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures showed no differences. While ciliated epithelial cells were the dominant cell type infected by both lineages, B/Victoria lineages had a slight preference for MUC5AC-positive cells, while B/Yamagata lineages infected more basal cells. Finally, while both lineages induced a strong interferon response 48 hours after infection of hNEC cultures, the B/Victoria lineages showed a much stronger induction of interferon related signaling pathways compared to B/Yamagata. This demonstrates that the two influenza B virus lineages differ not only in their antigenic structure but in their ability to induce host innate immune responses.","Wilson, Jo L.; Akin, Elgin; Zhou, Ruifeng; Jedlicka, Anne; Dziedzic, Amanda; Liu, Hsuan; Fenstermacher, Katherine Z.; Rothman, Richard; Pekosz, Andrew, 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: The influenza B virus Victoria and Yamagata lineages display distinct cell tropism and infection induced host gene expression in human nasal epithelial cell cultures"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/EQKCFP"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/EQKCFP</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2023-10-20T13:46:16Z","Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository","Wilson, Jo L.; Akin, Elgin; Zhou, Ruifeng; Jedlicka, Anne; Dziedzic, Amanda; Liu, Hsuan; Fenstermacher, Katherine Z.; Rothman, Richard; Pekosz, Andrew, 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: The influenza B virus Victoria and Yamagata lineages display distinct cell tropism and infection induced host gene expression in human nasal epithelial cell cultures"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/EQKCFP, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",19

Parsimonious mathematical models are useful in quantifying parameters related to the pathophysiology of T2D. Here we extend the minimum model developed to describe the glucose-insulin-glucagon dynamics in the isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusion (IIGI) experiment to the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The extended model describes glucose and hormone dynamics in OGTT including the contribution of the incretin hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), to insulin secretion. A new function describing glucose arrival from the gut is introduced. The model is fitted to OGTT data from 8 individuals with T2D and 8 weight-matched controls (CS) without diabetes to obtain parameters related to insulin sensitivity, beta- and alpha-cell function. The parameters, i.e., measures of insulin sensitivity, a1, suppression of glucagon secretion, k1, magnitude of glucagon secretion, γ2, and incretin-dependent insulin secretion, γ3, were found to be different between CS and T2D with p values < .002, < .017, < .009, < .004, respectively. A new rubric for estimating the incretin effect directly from modeling the OGTT is presented. The average incretin effect correlated well with the experimentally determined incretin effect with a Spearman Rank test correlation coefficient of .67 (p < .012). The average incretin effect was found to be different between CS and T2D (p <.032).

To evaluate the progress of management actions in the Bay's largest tributary, the Susquehanna River, we analyzed the long-term seasonal trends of flow-normalized N, P, and SS load over the last two to three decades, both above and below the Lower Susquehanna River Reservoir System. Our results indicate that annual and decadal-scale trends of nutrient and sediment load generally followed similar patterns in all four seasons, implying that changes in watershed function and land use had similar impacts on nutrient and sediment load at all times of the year. Above the reservoir system, the combined loads from the Marietta and Conestoga Stations indicate general trends of N, P, and SS reduction in the Susquehanna River Basin, which can most likely be attributed to a suite of management actions on point, agricultural, and stormwater sources. In contrast, upward trends of SS and particulate-associated P and N were generally observed below the Conowingo Reservoir since the mid-1990s. Our analyses suggest that (1) the reservoirs' capacity to trap these materials has been diminishing over the past two to three decades, and especially so for SS and P since the mid-1990s, and that (2) the Conowingo Reservoir has already neared its sediment storage capacity. These changes in reservoir performance will pose significant new kinds of challenges to attainment of total maximum daily load goals for the Susquehanna River Basin, and particularly if also accompanied by increases in storm frequency and intensity due to climate change. Accordingly, the reservoir issue may need to be factored into the proper establishment of regulatory load requirements and the development of watershed implementation plans.

We compare two models, one with and one without CDMs, and show that their presence leads to an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle over coastal and northern subpolar regions, which may exceed 2°C. The size and sign of the change are controlled by the interplay between enhanced shortwave heating of the surface, shading and cooling of the subsurface and the extent to which these are connected by vertical mixing. The changes in the seasonal cycle largely explain changes in the range of temperature extremes, an aspect of climate with important implications for ecosystem cycling. The modeled changes associated with CDMs have an intriguing resemblance to the observed trend in the annual cycle seen in recent decades, suggesting that more attention be paid to the role of “ocean yellowing” in global change.","Gnanadesikan, Anand; Kim, Grace E.; Pradal, Marie Aude S, 2019, ""Data associated with Gnanadesikan, Kim, and Pradal, Impact of colored dissolved materials on the annual cycle of sea surface temperature: Potential implications for extreme ocean temperatures"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/DG7RDP"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/DG7RDP</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2019-01-23T14:37:33Z","Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository","Gnanadesikan, Anand; Kim, Grace E.; Pradal, Marie Aude S, 2019, ""Data associated with Gnanadesikan, Kim, and Pradal, Impact of colored dissolved materials on the annual cycle of sea surface temperature: Potential implications for extreme ocean temperatures"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/DG7RDP, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",24

The impact of strain-specific biofilm properties on the retention of microplastic in stormwater biofilters","https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/ZQZX80","Stormwater biofilters have variable colloidal particle removal efficiencies that may be due to different characteristics of microorganisms colonizing them during normal operation. Little is known about how naturally occurring bacteria modify the surface properties of the filtration media, or how these modifications affect colloidal microplastic removal. We used simulated infiltration through model sand columns to study the impact of colonizing microorganisms on the retention of model colloidal microplastic particles, carboxyl-modified-latex (CML) beads. Four naturally occurring stormwater bacterial strains inhibited bead retention compared to a clean bed in a cell-density independent manner, while a model biofilm forming microorganism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) enhanced retention likely due to physical straining. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied to analyze interaction energy between CML and each bacterial strain biofilm surface. We found that interaction energy between CML and each strain was significantly different, and we propose that changes in the CML bead retention behavior are related to these differences. In particular, we propose that larger repulsive energy generated by some biofilms prevents close contact of CML to surface required for adhesion. Our evidence suggests that extra-cellular polymeric substances modify media surfaces to alter both adhesion and repulsion of beads. Overall, the work demonstrates how AFM can be used to characterize colloidal-collector interactions and provide insights into mechanisms that could be exploited to improve EIS design and operation. The purpose of this collection is to make available to the public the material necessary to validate the research findings.","Zhang, Yue; Preheim, Sarah P., 2019, ""Data associated with the manuscript by Zhang et al.

A detailed characterization of the aging IL10-deficient murine lung, a model of accelerated aging and frailty, reconciles features of both immunosenescence and lung aging in a coherent model. Airspace enlargement developed in the middle-aged (12-month old) and aged (20-22-month old) IL10-deficient lung punctuated by an expansion of macrophages and alveolar cell apoptosis. Compared to wild-type (WT) controls, the IL10-deficient lungs from young (4-month old) mice showed increased oxidative stress which was enhanced in both genotypes by aging. Active caspase 3 staining was increased in the alveolar epithelial cells of aged WT and mutant lungs but was greater in the IL10-deficient milieu. Lung macrophages were increased in the aged IL10-deficient lungs with exuberant expression of MMP12. IL10 treatment of naïve and M2-polarized bone marrow derived WT macrophages reduced MMP12 expression. Conditioned media studies demonstrated the secretome of aged mutant macrophages harbor reduced AECII prosurvival factors, specifically keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), promote cell death and reduce survival of primary alveolar epithelial cells. Compared to WT controls, aged IL10-deficient mice have increased parenchymal lymphoid collections comprised of a reduced number of apoptotic cells and B cells. We establish that IL10 is a key modulator of airspace homeostasis and lymphoid morphogenesis in the aging lung enabling macrophage-mediated alveolar epithelial cell survival and B cell survival within tertiary lymphoid structures.","Malinina, Alla; Dikeman, Dustin; Westbrook, Reyhan; Moats, Michelle; Gidner, Sarah; Poonyagariyagorn, Hataya; Walston, Jeremy; Neptune, Enid, 2021, ""Data associated with publication &quot;IL10 deficiency promotes alveolar enlargement and lymphoid dysmorphogenesis in the aged murine lung&quot;"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/4RZTRN"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/4RZTRN</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2021-11-05T18:59:17Z","Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository","Malinina, Alla; Dikeman, Dustin; Westbrook, Reyhan; Moats, Michelle; Gidner, Sarah; Poonyagariyagorn, Hataya; Walston, Jeremy; Neptune, Enid, 2021, ""Data associated with publication ""IL10 deficiency promotes alveolar enlargement and lymphoid dysmorphogenesis in the aged murine lung"""", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/4RZTRN, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",20

However, the nature of acetylcholine signaling within regions of cholinergic-dependent plasticity and how it changes with experience is poorly understood, much less the impact of amyloidosis on this signaling. Therefore, we optically measure the release profile of acetylcholine to unexpected, predicted, and predictive events in visual cortex (VC)—a site of known cholinergic-dependent plasticity—in a preclinical mouse model of AD that develops amyloidosis. We find that acetylcholine exhibits reinforcement signaling qualities, reporting behaviorally-relevant outcomes and displaying release profiles to predictive and predicted events that change as a consequence of experience. We identify three stages of amyloidosis occurring prior to the degeneration of cholinergic synapses within VC and observe that cholinergic responses in amyloid-bearing mice become impaired over these stages, diverging progressively from age- and sex-matched littermate controls. In particular, amyloidosis degrades signaling of unexpected rewards and punishments, and attenuates the experience-dependent 1) increase of cholinergic responses to outcome predictive visual cues, and 2) decrease of cholinergic responses to predicted outcomes. Hyperactive spontaneous acetylcholine release occurring transiently at the onset of impaired cholinergic signaling is also observed, further implicating disrupted cholinergic activity as an early functional biomarker in AD. Our findings suggest that acetylcholine acts as a reinforcement signal that is impaired by amyloidosis prior to pathological degeneration of the cholinergic system, providing a deeper understanding of the effects of amyloidosis on acetylcholine signaling and informing future interventions for AD.","Allard, Simon; Hussain Shuler, Marshall G., 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: Cholinergic reinforcement signaling is impaired by amyloidosis prior to its synaptic loss."", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/AVOEQR"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/AVOEQR</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2023-10-12T07:54:20Z","Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository","Allard, Simon; Hussain Shuler, Marshall G., 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: Cholinergic reinforcement signaling is impaired by amyloidosis prior to its synaptic loss."", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/AVOEQR, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",24

From the abstract: In the vascular niche, the extracellular matrix (ECM) provides a structural scaffold with a rich ligand landscape of essential matrix proteins that supports the organization and stabilization of endothelial cells (ECs) into functional blood vessels. Many of the physical interactions between ECs and macromolecular components of the ECM occur at both the micron and submicron scale. In addition, the elasticity of the ECM has been shown to be a critical factor in the progress of the angiogenic cascade. Here, we sought to determine the effect of substrate topography and elasticity (stiffness) on EC behavior. Utilizing a unique SiO2 substrate with an array of micropillars, we first demonstrate that micropillars with heights >3 μm significantly decrease EC adhesion and spreading. Fibronectin (Fn) patterning of 1 μm high micropillars enabled EC adhesion onto the micropillars and promoted alignment in a single-cell chain manner. We then developed a robust method to generate a soft micropillar substrate array made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), similar to the SiO2 substrate. Finally, we examined the kinetics of EC adhesion and spreading on the soft PDMS substrates compared to the stiff SiO2 substrates. Culturing cells on the PDMS substrates demonstrated an enhanced EC elongation and alignment when compared to stiff SiO2 with similar topographical features. We conclude that the elongation and alignment of ECs is coregulated by substrate topography and stiffness and can be harnessed to guide vascular organization.","Dickinson, Laura E.; Rand, Dannielle R.; Tsao, Joanna; Eberle, Wolfgang; Gerecht, Sharon, 2013, ""Data associated with: Endothelial cell responses to micropillar substrates of varying dimensions and stiffness"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T17P8W98"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T17P8W98</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V3","2015-08-25T00:00:00Z","Dr. Sharon Gerecht Lab","Dickinson, Laura E.; Rand, Dannielle R.; Tsao, Joanna; Eberle, Wolfgang; Gerecht, Sharon, 2013, ""Data associated with: Endothelial cell responses to micropillar substrates of varying dimensions and stiffness"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T17P8W98, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V3",52

From the abstract: Hyaluronic acid, a nonsulfated, linear glycosaminoglycan, is ubiquitously distributed in the extracellular matrix and is known to facilitate tumor progression by enhancing invasion, growth, and angiogenesis. Native HA has been attached to substrates to create patterned surfaces resistant to cell adhesion, and has been utilized in a variety of cell adhesion studies using either non covalently bound layers patterned by soft lithography or related methods. We use a new approach to study cell interactions with HA-presenting regions, by covalently linking HA adjacent to PEG-ylated regions, which resist cell adhesion. Colon and breast cancer cells seeded on the patterned HA surfaces adhere preferentially on HA-presenting regions and proliferate there. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cell adhesion is inhibited with the blocking of HA receptor, CD44, and that cellular adhesive processes, through protrusions spreading onto the HA surface, enhance spreading and movement outside the HA-presenting regions. Overall, this approach allows high-resolution analysis of cancer cell attachment, growth, and migration on exogenous native HA.","Dickinson, Laura E.; Ho, Chia Chi; Wang, Geoffrey, M.; Stebe, Kathleen J.; Gerecht, Sharon, 2013, ""Data associated with: Functional surfaces for high-resolution analysis of cancer cell interactions on exogenous hyaluronic acid"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1H41PBJ"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1H41PBJ</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V3","2015-08-25T00:00:00Z","Dr. Sharon Gerecht Lab","Dickinson, Laura E.; Ho, Chia Chi; Wang, Geoffrey, M.; Stebe, Kathleen J.; Gerecht, Sharon, 2013, ""Data associated with: Functional surfaces for high-resolution analysis of cancer cell interactions on exogenous hyaluronic acid"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1H41PBJ, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V3",33

We investigated synthetic, tunable hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels and determined both the adhesion and degradation parameters that enable human endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) to form efficient vascular networks. Entrapped ECFCs underwent tubulogenesis dependent on the cellular interactions with the HA hydrogel during each stage of vascular morphogenesis. Vacuole and lumen formed through integrins α5β1 and αVβ3, while branching and sprouting were enabled by HA hydrogel degradation. Vascular networks formed within HA hydrogels containing ECFCs anastomosed with the host's circulation and supported blood flow in the hydrogel after transplantation. Collectively, we show that the signaling pathways of vascular morphogenesis of ECFCs can be precisely regulated in a synthetic matrix, resulting in a functional microvasculature useful for the study of 3-dimensional vascular biology and toward a range of vascular disorders and approaches in tissue regeneration.

It can impair decision-making and is a prominent feature of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We propose that evaluation of doubt during decision-making provides a useful endophenotype with which to study the underlying pathophysiology of OCD and potentially other psychopathologies. For the current study, we developed a new instrument, the Doubt Questionnaire, to clinically assess doubt, and evaluated its psychometric properties. The random dot motion task was used to measure reaction time and subjective certainty, at varying levels of perceptual difficulty, in individuals who scored high and low on doubt, and in individuals with and without OCD. We found that doubt scores were significantly higher in OCD cases than controls. Drift diffusion modeling revealed that high doubt scores predicted slower evidence accumulation than did low doubt scores; and OCD diagnosis lower than controls. At higher levels of dot coherence, OCD participants exhibited significantly slower drift rates than did controls. In addition, at higher levels of coherence, high doubt subjects exhibited even slower drift rates and reaction times than low doubt subjects. Moreover, under high coherence conditions, individuals with high doubt scores reported lower certainty in their decisions than did those with low doubt scores. We conclude that the Doubt Questionnaire is a useful instrument for measuring doubt. Compared to those with low doubt, those with high doubt accumulate evidence more slowly and report lower certainty when making decisions under conditions of low uncertainty. High doubt may affect the decision-making process in individuals with OCD. The dimensional doubt measure is a useful endophenotype for OCD research and could enable computationally rigorous and neurally valid understanding of decision-making and its pathological expression in OCD and other disorders.","Marton, Tanya; Shuler, Marshall; Samuels, Jack; Nestadt, Paul; Krasnow, Janice; Wang, Ying; Kamath, Vidulata; Bakker, Arnold; Nestadt, Gerald; Chib, Vikram S., 2019, ""Datasets associated with &ldquo;Validating a dimension of doubt in decision-making: a proposed endophenotype for obsessive-compulsive disorder&rdquo;"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/DP2U9M"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/DP2U9M</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V2, UNF:6:VJXGdTmfXoqpFVBay4scWw== [fileUNF]","2019-07-10T18:25:43Z","Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository","Marton, Tanya; Shuler, Marshall; Samuels, Jack; Nestadt, Paul; Krasnow, Janice; Wang, Ying; Kamath, Vidulata; Bakker, Arnold; Nestadt, Gerald; Chib, Vikram S., 2019, ""Datasets associated with “Validating a dimension of doubt in decision-making: a proposed endophenotype for obsessive-compulsive disorder”"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/DP2U9M, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V2, UNF:6:VJXGdTmfXoqpFVBay4scWw== [fileUNF]",168

Here, we demonstrate in mouse models of metastatic breast cancer that IONPs can alter the host immune landscape leading to systemic immune-mediated disease suppression. We report that a single intravenous injection of IONPs can inhibit primary tumor growth, suppress metastases, and extend survival. Gene expression analysis revealed activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways involving signaling via Toll/Interleukin-1 Receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β (TRIF), a TLR pathway adaptor protein. Requisite participation of TRIF in suppressing tumor progression was demonstrated with histopathologic evidence of upregulated IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a downstream protein, and confirmed in a TRIF knockout syngeneic mouse model of metastatic breast cancer. Neither starch-coated polystyrene nanoparticles lacking iron, nor iron-containing dextran-coated parenteral iron replacement agent, induced significant antitumor effects suggesting a dependence on the type of IONP formulation. Analysis of multiple independent clinical databases support a hypothesis that upregulation of TLR3 and IRF3 correlates with increased overall survival among breast cancer patients. Taken together, these data support a compelling rationale to re-examine IONP formulations as harboring anti-cancer immune (nano)adjuvant properties to generate therapeutic benefit without requiring uptake by cancer cells.","Korangath, Preethi; Jin, Lu; Yang, Chun-Ting; Healy, Sean; Guo, Xin; Ke, Suqi; Gr&uuml;ttner, Cordula; Hu, Chen; Gabrielson, Kathleen; Foote, Jeremy; Clarke, Robert; Ivkov, Robert, 2024, ""Data associated with the publication: Iron oxide nanoparticles inhibit tumor progression and suppress lung metastases in mouse models of breast cancer"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/KTOG9W"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/KTOG9W</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2024-05-02T20:09:40Z","Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository","Korangath, Preethi; Jin, Lu; Yang, Chun-Ting; Healy, Sean; Guo, Xin; Ke, Suqi; Grüttner, Cordula; Hu, Chen; Gabrielson, Kathleen; Foote, Jeremy; Clarke, Robert; Ivkov, Robert, 2024, ""Data associated with the publication: Iron oxide nanoparticles inhibit tumor progression and suppress lung metastases in mouse models of breast cancer"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/KTOG9W, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",25

Perturbation theory (PT) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are used to make thermodynamic predictions of the voltages required to obtain all particles within a crystalline phase for different system sizes. These results show good agreement with video microscopy (VM) measurements of colloidal crystals contain ing 75–300 particles. Colloidal assembly kinetic trajectories for the same system sizes are quantified from VM experiments using order parameters (reaction coordinates) to capture real-space local and global hexagonal ordering. These trajectories are fit with a Smoluchowski model to extract configuration dependent free energy and diffusivity landscapes (FEL, DL) that capture the microscopic details of assembly dynamics. Landscape features, such as the number and heights of barriers and local gradients, capture the formation, diffusion, and migration of grain boundaries in polycrystalline states, which are increasingly prevalent for n > 200 but vanish for n < 150. These results demonstrate the importance of system size effects in the formation and annealing of polycrystalline states in colloidal crystallization processes.

Metagenomic sequencing can be used to identify how genes change in response to environmental variables. However, relatively few studies directly compare gene changes to biogeochemical model predictions of corresponding processes, especially in dynamic estuarine ecosystems. We aim to understand the major drivers of spatiotemporal shifts in microbial genes and genomes within the water column of the Chesapeake and highlight the largest discrepancies of these observations with our model predictions. We used previously published shotgun metagenomic datasets, collected across multiple months, sites, and water column positions within Chesapeake Bay in 2017, and a metatranscriptomic dataset collected at one site in the Bay in 2010-2011. We found the largest changes in the relative abundance of genes involved in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolism associated with variables that change with depth and season (e.g. pH, phosphate, water temperature). Several major trends and key relationships between genes and environmental parameters deviate from distributions expected by the model, such as discrepancies between genes mediating nitrification, higher than expected abundance and expression of denitrification genes in aerobic waters, and nitrogen fixation genes in environments with relatively high ammonia but low oxygen concentrations. While more work is needed to determine the biogeochemical consequences of gene abundance deviating from our model predictions, it provides insight into processes that can be targeted for future study to better understand factors that influence gene abundance changes in an important estuarine ecosystem.","Preheim, Sarah; Morris, Shaina; Zhang, Yue; Holder, Chris; Arora-Williams, Keith; Gensbigler, Paul; Hinton, Amanda; Jin, Rui; Pradal, Marie-Aude; Gnanadesikan, Anand, 2022, ""Data associated with the publication: Major trends and environmental correlates of spatiotemporal shifts in the distribution of genes compared to a biogeochemical model simulation in the Chesapeake Bay"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/K08BJZ"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/K08BJZ</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2022-09-06T17:25:29Z","Dr. Sarah Preheim's Lab Publication Datasets","Preheim, Sarah; Morris, Shaina; Zhang, Yue; Holder, Chris; Arora-Williams, Keith; Gensbigler, Paul; Hinton, Amanda; Jin, Rui; Pradal, Marie-Aude; Gnanadesikan, Anand, 2022, ""Data associated with the publication: Major trends and environmental correlates of spatiotemporal shifts in the distribution of genes compared to a biogeochemical model simulation in the Chesapeake Bay"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/K08BJZ, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",65

RNA-guided enzymes must quickly search a vast sequence space for their targets. This search is aided by chaperones such as Hfq, a protein that mediates regulation by bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs). How RNA binding proteins enhance this search is little known. Using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer, we show that E. coli Hfq performs a one-dimensional scan in which compaction of the target RNA delivers sRNAs to sites distant from the location of Hfq recruitment. We also show that Hfq can transfer an sRNA between different target sites in a single mRNA, favoring the most stable duplex. We propose that compaction and segmental transfer, combined with repeated cycles of base pairing, enable the kinetic selection of optimal sRNA targets. Finally, we show that RNA compaction and sRNA transfer require conserved arginine patches. We suggest that arginine patches are a widespread strategy for enabling the movement of RNA across protein surfaces.","Malecka-Grajek, Ewelina; Woodson, Sarah, 2024, ""Data associated with the publication: RNA compaction and iterative scanning for small RNA targets by the Hfq chaperone."", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/YPUEQT"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/YPUEQT</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2024-02-01T20:27:23Z","JHU Woodson Laboratory Data Archive","Malecka-Grajek, Ewelina; Woodson, Sarah, 2024, ""Data associated with the publication: RNA compaction and iterative scanning for small RNA targets by the Hfq chaperone."", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/YPUEQT, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",17

The glmS ribozyme riboswitch, located in the 5’ UTR of the Bacillus subtilis glmS mRNA, regulates cell wall biosynthesis through ligand-induced self-cleavage and decay of the glmS mRNA. Although self-cleavage of the refolded glmS ribozyme has been studied extensively, the kinetics of ribozyme folding and ligand binding during transcription is not understood. Here, we combine TIRF single-molecule assays with kinetic modeling to show that self-cleavage can occur during transcription before the ribozyme is fully synthesized. Moreover, co-transcriptional folding of the RNA at a physiological elongation rate allows the ribozyme core itself to become reactive. DMS footprinting further revealed how slow sequential folding favors formation of the native core structure through fraying of misfolded helices and nucleation of a native pseudoknot. Ribozyme self-cleavage at an early stage of transcription may benefit glmS regulation in B. subtilis, as it exposes the mRNA to exoribonuclease before translation starts. Our results emphasize the importance of co-transcriptional folding of RNA tertiary structure for cis-regulation of mRNA stability.","Lou, Yuan; Woodson, Sarah A., 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: Co-transcriptional folding of the glmS ribozyme enables a rapid response to metabolite"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/5QMDY6"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/5QMDY6</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1, UNF:6:cWYMPedxN8VGoLROcKjzfA== [fileUNF]","2023-08-25T12:04:54Z","JHU Woodson Laboratory Data Archive","Lou, Yuan; Woodson, Sarah A., 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: Co-transcriptional folding of the glmS ribozyme enables a rapid response to metabolite"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/5QMDY6, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1, UNF:6:cWYMPedxN8VGoLROcKjzfA== [fileUNF]",23

Vascular smooth muscle cells (v-SMCs) provide physical support to the vasculature and aid in maintaining endothelial viability. In this study, we show an efficient derivation of v-SMCs from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and demonstrate their functionality and ability to support the vasculature in vitro. Human ESCs were differentiated in monolayers and supplemented with platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1). Human ESC-derived smooth-muscle-like cells (SMLCs) were found to highly express specific smooth muscle cell (SMC) markers—including α-smooth muscle actin, calponin, SM22, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain—to produce and secrete fibronectin and collagen, and to contract in response to carbachol. In vitro tubulogenesis assays revealed that these hESC-derived SMLCs interacted with human endothelial progenitor cell (EPCs) to form longer and thicker cord-like structures in vitro. We have demonstrated a simple protocol for the efficient derivation of highly purified SMLCs from hESCs. These in vitro functional SMLCs interacted with EPCs to support and augment capillary-like structures (CLSs), demonstrating the potential of hESCs as a cell source for therapeutic vascular tissue engineering.","Vo, Elaine; Hanjaya-Putra, Donny; Zha, Yuanting; Kusuma, Sravanti; Gerecht, Sharon, 2013, ""Data associated with: Smooth-Muscle-Like cells derived from human embryonic stem cells support and augment cord-like structures in vitro"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1WD3XHM"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1WD3XHM</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V3","2015-08-25T00:00:00Z","Dr. Sharon Gerecht Lab","Vo, Elaine; Hanjaya-Putra, Donny; Zha, Yuanting; Kusuma, Sravanti; Gerecht, Sharon, 2013, ""Data associated with: Smooth-Muscle-Like cells derived from human embryonic stem cells support and augment cord-like structures in vitro"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1WD3XHM, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V3",41

Active sensing can facilitate this process by engaging motor systems in the sampling of sensory information. The echolocating bat serves as an excellent model to investigate the coupling between action and sensing, because it adaptively controls both the acoustic signals used to probe the environment, and movements to receive echoes at the auditory periphery. We report here that the echolocating bat controls the features of its sonar vocalizations in tandem with the positioning of the outer ears to maximize acoustic cues for target detection and localization. The bat’s adaptive control of sonar vocalizations and ear positioning occurs on a millisecond time-scale to capture spatial information from arriving echoes, as well as on a longer time-scale, to track target movement. Our results demonstrate that purposeful control over sound production and reception can serve to improve acoustic cues for localization tasks. This finding also highlights the general importance of movement to sensory processing across animal species. Finally, our discoveries point to important parallels between spatial perception by echolocation and vision.","Wohlgemuth, Melville J; Kothari, Ninad B; Moss, Cynthia F, 2016, ""Data associated with publication: Action enhances acoustic cues for 3-D target localization by echolocating bats."", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1W66HPZ"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1W66HPZ</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V3","2016-09-08T00:00:00Z","Comparative Neural Systems and Behavioral Lab - Moss Lab","Wohlgemuth, Melville J; Kothari, Ninad B; Moss, Cynthia F, 2016, ""Data associated with publication: Action enhances acoustic cues for 3-D target localization by echolocating bats."", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1W66HPZ, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V3",127

Microbial processes in low oxygen environments have important ecosystem-level consequences, such as denitrification, greenhouse gas production and acidification. To identify key microbial processes occurring in low oxygen bottom waters of the Chesapeake Bay, we sequenced both 16S rRNA genes and shotgun metagenomic libraries to determine the identity, functional potential and spatiotemporal distribution of microbial populations in the water column. Unsupervised clustering algorithms grouped samples into three clusters using water chemistry or microbial communities, with extensive overlap of cluster composition between methods. Clusters were strongly differentiated by temperature, salinity, and oxygen. Sulfide-oxidizing microorganisms were found to be enriched in the low-oxygen bottom water and predictive of hypoxic conditions. Metagenome assembled genomes demonstrate that some of these sulfide-oxidizing populations are capable of partial denitrification, and transcriptionally active in a prior study. These results establish the importance of sulfide-oxidizing microorganisms in the microbial response to low oxygen in the Chesapeake Bay and suggest ties between the sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen cycles that could be important to capture when predicting the ecosystem response to remediation efforts or climate change.","Arora-Williams, Keith; Holder, Christopher; Secor, Maeve; Ellis, Hugh; Xia, Meng; Gnanadesikan, Anand; Preheim, Sarah P., 2022, ""Data associated with the publication: Abundant and Persistent Sulfide-oxidizing Microbial Populations are Responsive to Hypoxia in the Chesapeake Bay"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/NL3HTW"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/NL3HTW</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V2, UNF:6:h5eX1XIx3taJ2wu4w7z2bA== [fileUNF]","2023-05-16T18:53:51Z","Dr. Sarah Preheim's Lab Publication Datasets","Arora-Williams, Keith; Holder, Christopher; Secor, Maeve; Ellis, Hugh; Xia, Meng; Gnanadesikan, Anand; Preheim, Sarah P., 2022, ""Data associated with the publication: Abundant and Persistent Sulfide-oxidizing Microbial Populations are Responsive to Hypoxia in the Chesapeake Bay"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/NL3HTW, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V2, UNF:6:h5eX1XIx3taJ2wu4w7z2bA== [fileUNF]",94

Evidenced by the success of the continuous glucose monitor in managing Type 1 Diabetes, these sensors are capable of precise, accurate measurements in unprocessed biological environments. Nucleic acid-based electrochemical sensors (NBEs) are a specific type of biosensor that employs the target binding and conformational dynamics of nucleic acids for signal transduction. Currently, the vast majority of NBEs are fabricated via self-assembly of alkylthiols on Au electrodes. However, this architecture is limited in scope, as Au electrodes are not universally deployable for all potential NBE applications. Here, to expand the repertoire of materials on which NBEs can be made, we describe the multistep procedure for creating sensing monolayers of alkylphosphonic acids on a conductive oxide surface. Using such monolayers on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides, we couple redox reporter-modified nucleic acids and demonstrate signaling of procaine-binding NBE sensors in buffer and human serum. We investigate the operational stability of these NBE sensors to reveal faster signal loss relative to benchmark thiol-on-gold sensing layers, a result that arises due to poor stability of the underlying ITO. Finally, we discuss future directions to continue expansion of NBE sensor materials and applications.","Shaver, Alexander; Arroyo-Curr&aacute;s, Netzahualc&oacute;yotl, 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: Expanding the monolayer scope for nucleic acid-based electrochemical sensors beyond thiols on gold: Alkylphosphonic acids on ITO"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/I0H3GY"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/I0H3GY</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2023-07-21T20:11:46Z","JHU Arroyo Laboratory Data Archive","Shaver, Alexander; Arroyo-Currás, Netzahualcóyotl, 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: Expanding the monolayer scope for nucleic acid-based electrochemical sensors beyond thiols on gold: Alkylphosphonic acids on ITO"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/I0H3GY, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",23

This book examines how the civic legacies of past struggles for democracy shape current movements for immigrant rights. Examining three industrial democracies in Northeast Asia with overlapping immigration and citizenship policies, immigrant populations, and immigration histories, this book offers insights into the gaps between state policies and immigrant political behavior across similarly situated countries. In addition to comparing policy reforms, state-institutionalized rights for migrants, and immigrant incorporation policies, programs, and services, this project seeks to better understand the process of political incorporation through the lens of migrants themselves. In order to understand the incentives and disincentives for particular forms of political engagement as well as immigrant strategies for political empowerment, the methods employed must allow the respondents to generate their own questions, concepts, and categorizations. In addition to Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese government publications and archival materials, the project relies on a combination of questionnaires, over 150 in-depth interviews with immigrants, pro-immigrant activists, and government officials, and 28 focus groups with immigrant communities in the three countries. The Immigrant Incorporation in East Asian Democracies (IIEAD) Project contains the focus group data associated with this book. In Japan, the focus groups consisted of migrants from the Korean peninsula, mainland China, the Philippines, Brazil, Peru, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia; in Korea, participants were nationals of mainland China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Mongolia, and Myanmar; and, in Taiwan, participants consisted of migrants from Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. The IIEAD collection contains transcripts and English translations of 16 focus groups from the study: eight conducted in Japan and eight in South Korea. The focus group transcripts from Taiwan are not included in the IIEAD collection due to their sensitive nature. In order to ensure the confidentiality of the focus group participants, all personal identifiers have been removed from the transcripts in the IIEAD collection, including participants’ names, self-introductions at the beginning of the focus groups, and informal conversations that either contained personal information or that were between participants and not meant to be directed at the group.

This finding is surprising since an isolated band of PV is barotropically unstable, a result going back to Rayleigh. Here we investigate the stability of a Mars-like annular vortex using numerical integrations of the rotating shallow water equations. We show how the mode of instability and its growth rate depends upon the latitude and width of the annulus. By introducing thermal relaxation towards an annular equilibrium profile with a time scale similar to that of the instability, we are able to simulate a persistent annular vortex with similar characteristics as that observed in the Martian atmosphere. This time scale, typically 0.5-2 sols, is similar to radiative relaxation time scales for Mars’ polar atmosphere. We also demonstrate that the persistence of an annular vortex is robust to topographic forcing, as long as it is below a certain amplitude. We hence propose that the persistence of this barotropically unstable annular vortex is permitted due to the combination of short radiative relaxation time scales and relatively weak topographic forcing in the Martian polar atmosphere.","Seviour, William J.

Much of the research around this topic in the auditory system has centered around human speech perception, in which categorical processes result in an enhanced sensitivity for acoustically meaningful differences and a reduced sensitivity for nonmeaningful distinctions. Much less is known about whether non-human primates process their species-specific vocalizations in a similar manner. We address this question in the common marmoset, a small arboreal New World primate with a rich vocal repertoire produced across a range of behavioral contexts. We first show that marmosets perceptually categorize their vocalizations in ways that correspond to previously defined call types for this species. Next, we show that marmosets are differentially sensitive to changes in particular acoustic features of their most common call types, and that these sensitivity differences are matched to the population statistics of their vocalizations in ways that likely maximize category formation. Finally, we show that marmosets are less sensitive to changes in these acoustic features when within the natural range of variability of their calls, which possibly reflects perceptual specializations which maintain existing call categories.

To determine the underlying computational principles, we build a realistic computational model of a central decision module within the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), the fly’s center for learning and memory. Our model combines the electron microscopy-based architecture of one MB output neuron (MBON-alpha 3), the synaptic connectivity of its 948 presynaptic Kenyon cells (KCs), and its in vivo membrane properties obtained from patch-clamp recordings. We show that this neuron is electrotonically compact and that synaptic input corresponding to simulated odor input robustly drives its spiking behavior. Therefore, sparse innervation by KCs can efficiently control and modulate MBON activity in response to learning with minimal requirements on the specificity of synaptic localization. This architecture allows efficient storage of large numbers of memories using the flexible stochastic connectivity of the circuit.","Hafez, Omar A.; Escribano, Benjamin; Rouven, Ziegler L.; Hirtz, Jan J.; Niebur, Ernst; Pielage, Jan, 2022, ""Data associated with the publication: The cellular architecture of memory modules in Drosophila supports stochastic input integration"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/HRK27V"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/HRK27V</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2022-03-07T20:18:52Z","Computational Neuroscience Laboratory","Hafez, Omar A.; Escribano, Benjamin; Rouven, Ziegler L.; Hirtz, Jan J.; Niebur, Ernst; Pielage, Jan, 2022, ""Data associated with the publication: The cellular architecture of memory modules in Drosophila supports stochastic input integration"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/HRK27V, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",148

The spatial pattern of change provides a “fingerprint” that is generally much larger than natural variability. Insofar as the response to radiative forcing is linear (the impact of quadrupling CO2 is twice the impact of doubling CO2) this fingerprint can then be used to estimate the impact of historical greenhouse gas forcing. However the degree to which biogeochemical cycles respond linearly to radiative forcing has rarely been tested. In this paper, we evaluate which ocean biogeochemical fields are likely to respond linearly to changing radiative forcing, which ones do not, and where linearity breaks down. We also demonstrate that the representation of lateral mixing by mesoscale eddies, which varies significantly across climate models, plays an important role in modulating the breakdown of linearity. Globally integrated surface rates of biogeochemical cycling (primary productivity, particulate export) respond in a relatively linear fashion and can be moderately sensitive to mixing. By contrast, the habitability of the interior ocean (as determined by hypoxia and calcite supersaturation) behaves nonlinearly and is very sensitive to mixing. This is because the deep ocean, as well as certain regions in the surface ocean, are very sensitive to the magnitude of deep wintertime convection. The cessation of convection under global warming is strongly modulated by the representation of eddy mixing.","Bahl, Alexis; Gnanadesikan, Anand; Pradal, Marie-Aude S., 2020, ""Data associated with the publication: Scaling global warming impacts on ocean ecosystems: Results from a suite of Earth System Models"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/AUBBJD"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/AUBBJD</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2020-08-28T15:17:53Z","Earth System Modeling at Johns Hopkins","Bahl, Alexis; Gnanadesikan, Anand; Pradal, Marie-Aude S., 2020, ""Data associated with the publication: Scaling global warming impacts on ocean ecosystems: Results from a suite of Earth System Models"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/AUBBJD, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",63

Recent publications have reported the ability of NHCs to support biomolecular receptors on gold substrates for sensing applications, and improved tolerance to prolonged biofluid exposure relative to thiols. However, important questions remain regarding the stability of these monolayers when subjected to voltage perturbations, which is needed for applications with electrochemical platforms. Here, we investigate the ability of two NHCs, 1,3-diisopropylbenzimidazole and 5-(ethoxycarbonyl)-1,3-diisopropylbenzimidazole, to form monolayers via self-assembly from methanolic solutions of their trifluoromethanesulfonate salts. We compare the electrochemical behavior of the resulting monolayers relative to that of benchmark mercaptohexanol monolayers in phosphate-buffered saline. Within the -0.15 to 0.25 V vs Ag|AgCl voltage window, NHC monolayers are stable on gold surfaces, wherein they electrochemically perform like thiol-based monolayers and undergo similar reorganization kinetics, displaying long-term stability under incubation in buffered media and under continuous voltammetric interrogation. At negative voltages, NHC monolayers cathodically desorb from the electrode surface at lower bias (-0.1 V) than thiol-based monolayers (-0.5 V). At voltages more positive than 0.25 V, NHC monolayers anodically desorb from electrode surfaces at similar voltages to thiol-based monolayers. These results highlight new limitations to NHC monolayer stability imposed by electrochemical interrogation of the underlying gold electrodes. Our results serve as a framework for future optimization of NHC monolayers on gold for electrochemical applications, as well as structure-functionality studies of NHCs on gold.","Pellitero, Miguel A.; Jensen, Isabel M.; Dominique, Nathaniel L.; Ekowo, Lilian C.; Camden, Jon P.; Jenkins, David M.; Arroyo-Curr&aacute;s, Netzahualc&oacute;yotl, 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: Stability of N-Heterocyclic carbene monolayers under continuous voltammetric interrogation"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/U5GUV3"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/U5GUV3</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2023-08-16T16:21:51Z","JHU Arroyo Laboratory Data Archive","Pellitero, Miguel A.; Jensen, Isabel M.; Dominique, Nathaniel L.; Ekowo, Lilian C.; Camden, Jon P.; Jenkins, David M.; Arroyo-Currás, Netzahualcóyotl, 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: Stability of N-Heterocyclic carbene monolayers under continuous voltammetric interrogation"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/U5GUV3, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",34

Such interactions afford a sensing versatility that is not supported by strategies that depend on target-specific reactivity. Thus, NBEs have significantly expanded the scope of molecules that can be monitored continuously in biological systems. However, the technology is limited by the lability of the thiol-based monolayers employed for sensor fabrication. Seeking to understand the main drivers of monolayer degradation, we studied four possible mechanisms of NBEs decay: (i) passive desorption of monolayer elements in undisturbed sensors, (ii) voltage-induced desorption under continuous voltammetric interrogation, (iii) competitive displacement by thiolated molecules naturally present in biofluids like serum, and (iv) protein binding. Our results indicate that voltage-induced desorption of monolayer elements is the main mechanism by which NBEs decay in phosphate-buffered saline. This degradation can be overcome by using a voltage window comprised between -0.2 V and 0.2 V vs Ag|AgCl, reported for the first time in this work, where electrochemical oxygen reduction and surface gold oxidation cannot occur. This result underscores the need for chemically stable redox reporters with more positive reduction potentials than the benchmark methylene blue, and able to cycle thousands of times between redox states to support continuous sensing for long periods. Additionally, in biofluids the rate of sensor decay is further accelerated by the presence of thiolated small molecules like cysteine and glutathione, which can competitively displace monolayer elements even in the absence of voltage-induced damage. We hope that this work will serve as a framework to inspire future development of novel sensor interfaces aiming to eliminate the mechanisms of signal decay in NBEs.","Clark, Vincent; Pellitero, Miguel A.; Arroyo-Curr&aacute;s, Netzahualc&oacute;yotl, 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: Explaining the decay of nucleic acid-based sensors under continuous voltammetric interrogation"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/IHPXXR"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/IHPXXR</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2023-05-15T17:37:25Z","Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository","Clark, Vincent; Pellitero, Miguel A.; Arroyo-Currás, Netzahualcóyotl, 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: Explaining the decay of nucleic acid-based sensors under continuous voltammetric interrogation"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/IHPXXR, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",33

This book examines how the civic legacies of past struggles for democracy shape current movements for immigrant rights. Examining three industrial democracies in Northeast Asia with overlapping immigration and citizenship policies, immigrant populations, and immigration histories, this book offers insights into the gaps between state policies and immigrant political behavior across similarly situated countries. In addition to comparing policy reforms, state-institutionalized rights for migrants, and immigrant incorporation policies, programs, and services, this project seeks to better understand the process of political incorporation through the lens of migrants themselves. In order to understand the incentives and disincentives for particular forms of political engagement as well as immigrant strategies for political empowerment, the methods employed must allow the respondents to generate their own questions, concepts, and categorizations. In addition to Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese government publications and archival materials, the project relies on a combination of questionnaires, over 150 in-depth interviews with immigrants, pro-immigrant activists, and government officials, and 28 focus groups with immigrant communities in the three countries. The Immigrant Incorporation in East Asian Democracies (IIEAD) Project contains the focus group data associated with this book. In Japan, the focus groups consisted of migrants from the Korean peninsula, mainland China, the Philippines, Brazil, Peru, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia; in Korea, participants were nationals of mainland China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Mongolia, and Myanmar; and, in Taiwan, participants consisted of migrants from Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. The IIEAD collection contains transcripts and English translations of 16 focus groups from the study: eight conducted in Japan and eight in South Korea. The focus group transcripts from Taiwan are not included in the IIEAD collection due to their sensitive nature. In order to ensure the confidentiality of the focus group participants, all personal identifiers have been removed from the transcripts in the IIEAD collection, including participants’ names, self-introductions at the beginning of the focus groups, and informal conversations that either contained personal information or that were between participants and not meant to be directed at the group.

We previously characterized OOR responses of normal chinchillas to whole-body tilt and translation and to prosthetic electrical stimulation targeting the utricle and saccule via electrodes implanted in otherwise normal ears. Here we extend that work to examine OOR responses to tilt and translation stimuli after unilateral intratympanic gentamicin injection and to natural/mechanical and prosthetic/electrical stimulation delivered separately or in combination to animals with bilateral vestibular hypofunction after right ear intratympanic gentamicin injection followed by surgical disruption of the left labyrinth at the time of electrode implantation. Unilateral intratympanic gentamicin injection decreased natural OOR response magnitude to about half of normal, without markedly changing OOR response direction or symmetry. Subsequent surgical disruption of the contralateral labyrinth at the time of electrode implantation surgery further decreased OOR magnitude during natural stimulation, consistent with bimodal-bilateral otolith end organ hypofunction (ototoxic on the right ear, surgical on the left ear). Delivery of pulse-frequency- or pulse-amplitude-modulated prosthetic/electrical stimulation targeting the left utricle and saccule in phase with whole-body tilt and translation motion stimuli yielded responses closer to normal than the deficient OOR responses of those same animals in response to head tilt and translation alone.","Chow, Margaret R.; Fernandez Brillet, Celia; Hageman, Kristin N.; Roberts, Dale C.; Ayiotis, Andrianna I.; Haque, Razi M.; Della Santina, Charles C., 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: Binocular 3D otolith-ocular reflexes: responses of chinchillas to natural and prosthetic stimulation after ototoxic injury and vestibular implantation."", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/C4RVLS"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/C4RVLS</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V2","2024-01-09T16:15:38Z","Johns Hopkins Vestibular NeuroEngineering Laboratory","Chow, Margaret R.; Fernandez Brillet, Celia; Hageman, Kristin N.; Roberts, Dale C.; Ayiotis, Andrianna I.; Haque, Razi M.; Della Santina, Charles C., 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: Binocular 3D otolith-ocular reflexes: responses of chinchillas to natural and prosthetic stimulation after ototoxic injury and vestibular implantation."", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/C4RVLS, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V2",124

Although DCs cultured with BP revealed high levels of nanoparticle uptake, neither JAWSII dendritic cells nor bone marrow derived cells (BMDCs) showed significant changes in marker expression. To assess whether BP interactions in vivo produced different effects, we analyzed CD80, CD86, and MHC II expression of DCs recovered from the livers, spleens, bone marrows, and lymph nodes of mice injected once with BP (5 mg Fe). Interestingly, only DCs in spleens and bone marrows responded to BP exposure. DCs recovered from other tissues and organs showed no evidence of increased activation. These findings highlight complex effects with systemic exposure to nanoparticles, and their potential to mediate specific and selective activation of innate immune cells, which depends on the tissue site and features of the extracellular environment.

Expanded huntingtin (expHTT) mRNA forms aggregates that sequester essential RNA binding proteins, dysregulating mRNA processing and translation. The physical basis of RNA aggregation has been difficult to disentangle owing to the heterogeneous structure of the CAG repeats. Here, we probe the folding and unfolding pathways of expHTT mRNA using single-molecule force spectroscopy. Whereas normal HTT mRNAs unfold reversibly and cooperatively, expHTT mRNAs with 20 or 40 CAG repeats slip and unravel non-cooperatively at low tension. Slippage of CAG base pairs is punctuated by concerted rearrangement of adjacent CCG trinucleotides, trapping partially folded structures that readily base pair with another RNA strand. We suggest that the conformational entropy of the CAG repeats, combined with stable CCG base pairs, creates a stick-slip behavior that explains the aggregation propensity of expHTT mRNA. This dataset comprises metadata, analysis scripts, single molecule force recordings, and analyzed data used to create the figures in this manuscript.","O'Brien, Brett M.; Jim&eacute;nez-Avalos, Gabriel; Kaiser, Christian M.; Woodson, Sarah A., 2024, ""Data associated with the publication: Stick-slip unfolding favors self-association of expanded HTT mRNA"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/GTUUUG"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/GTUUUG</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2024-07-08T13:12:05Z","JHU Woodson Laboratory Data Archive","O'Brien, Brett M.; Jiménez-Avalos, Gabriel; Kaiser, Christian M.; Woodson, Sarah A., 2024, ""Data associated with the publication: Stick-slip unfolding favors self-association of expanded HTT mRNA"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/GTUUUG, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",0

Like other functional RNAs, ribozymes encode a conserved catalytic center supported by peripheral domains that vary among ribozyme sub-families. To understand how core-periphery interactions contribute to ribozyme fitness, we compared the cleavage kinetics of all single base substitutions at 152 sites across the Bacillus subtilis glmS ribozyme by high-throughput sequencing (ClvSeq). The in vitro activity map mirrored phylogenetic sequence conservation in glmS ribozymes, indicating that biological fitness reports all biochemically important positions. The results showed that most deleterious mutations lower activity by impairing ribozyme self-assembly. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the complete ribozyme revealed how individual mutations in the core or the IL4 peripheral loop rewire the network of hydrogen bonds around the catalytic site. Peripheral IL4 mutations introduce a non-native tertiary interface that corrupts folding of the wild type core, eliminating activity. The results illustrate how competition between native and non-native structures in RNA drives the natural selection of central and peripheral tertiary interaction motifs.","Yu, Li-Eng; White, Elise N.; Woodson, Sarah A., 2024, ""Data associated with the publication: Optimized periphery-core interface increases fitness of the Bacillus subtilis glmS ribozyme"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/JDHWJN"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/JDHWJN</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2024-07-19T14:23:02Z","JHU Woodson Laboratory Data Archive","Yu, Li-Eng; White, Elise N.; Woodson, Sarah A., 2024, ""Data associated with the publication: Optimized periphery-core interface increases fitness of the Bacillus subtilis glmS ribozyme"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/JDHWJN, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",0

More complex functions can be performed by multiple cells that coordinate as they perform different subtasks. Cell−cell communication using molecular signals is particularly suited for aiding in this communication, but the number of molecules that can be used in different communication channels is limited. Here we investigate how proteases can limit the transmission range of communicating cells. We find that adding barrierpepsin to Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells in two dimensional multicellular networks that use α-factor signaling prevents cells beyond a specific radius from responding to α-factor signals. Such limiting of the broadcast range of cells could allow multiple cells to use the same signaling molecules to direct different communication processes and functions, provided that they are far enough from one another. These results suggest a means by which complex synthetic cellular networks using only a few signals for communication could be created by structuring a community of cells to create distinct broadcast environments.","Cole, Joshua; Schulman, Rebecca B., 2024, ""Data associated with the publication: Limiting the broadcast range of a secreting cell during intercellular 2 signaling using protease-mediated degradation"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/V4BATB"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/V4BATB</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2024-07-31T13:11:09Z","Synthetic Biomolecular Machines Lab Dataverse","Cole, Joshua; Schulman, Rebecca B., 2024, ""Data associated with the publication: Limiting the broadcast range of a secreting cell during intercellular 2 signaling using protease-mediated degradation"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/V4BATB, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",16

However, no apparent mutations were identified in the HA gene segment of dominant H3N2 viruses, and the severity of the season could not be solely attributed to a vaccine mismatch. Clinical samples from the Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance network during the 2016-17 and 2017-18 influenza seasons were sequenced to target influenza A virus. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on viral whole genome sequences. Representative viral isolates of the two seasons were characterized in immortalized cell lines and human nasal epithelial cell cultures, and demographic data and clinical outcomes of patients were analyzed. Unique H3N2 reassortment events were observed, resulting in two predominant strains in the 2017-18 season: HA clade 3C.2a2 and clade 3C.3a, which had novel gene segment constellations containing gene segments from HA clade 3C.2a1 viruses. The reassortant re3C.2a2 viruses replicated with faster kinetics and to a higher peak titer compared to the parental 3C.2a2 and 3C.2a1 viruses, which may have contributed to the increased severity. The reassortant re3C.3a was able to infect an older population more effectively compared to the parental 3C.3a, perhaps through evasion of preexisting NA antibodies. Our findings suggest that the increased severity of the 2017-18 influenza season was due in part to two intrasubtypes, co-circulating H3N2 reassortant viruses with fitness advantages over the parental viruses. This information may help inform future vaccine development and public health policies.","Liu, Hsuan; Shaw-Saliba, Kathryn; Westerbeck, Jason; Jacobs, David; Fenstermacher, Katherine; Chao, Chia-Yu; Gong, Yu-Nong; Powell, Harrison; Ma, Zexu; Mehoke, Thomas; Ernlund, Amanda W.; Dziedzic, Amanda; Vyas, Siddhant; Evans, Jared; Sauer, Lauren M.; Rothman, Richard E.; Thielen, Peter; Chen, Kuan-Fu; Pekosz, Andrew, 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: The impact of human H3N2 influenza virus reassortment during 2017-18 on increased influenza cases and disease severity: enhanced virus replication and neuraminidase antibody immune evasion"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/FPN6MI"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/FPN6MI</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1, UNF:6:gFmD9sqIJS8/HSIIQaij3w== [fileUNF]","2023-08-03T20:18:29Z","Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository","Liu, Hsuan; Shaw-Saliba, Kathryn; Westerbeck, Jason; Jacobs, David; Fenstermacher, Katherine; Chao, Chia-Yu; Gong, Yu-Nong; Powell, Harrison; Ma, Zexu; Mehoke, Thomas; Ernlund, Amanda W.; Dziedzic, Amanda; Vyas, Siddhant; Evans, Jared; Sauer, Lauren M.; Rothman, Richard E.; Thielen, Peter; Chen, Kuan-Fu; Pekosz, Andrew, 2023, ""Data associated with the publication: The impact of human H3N2 influenza virus reassortment during 2017-18 on increased influenza cases and disease severity: enhanced virus replication and neuraminidase antibody immune evasion"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/FPN6MI, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1, UNF:6:gFmD9sqIJS8/HSIIQaij3w== [fileUNF]",4

A meta-analysis of chatbot-assisted language learning","https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/XOL4BR","Given the importance of conversation practice in language learning, chatbots, especially ChatGPT, have attracted considerable attention for their ability to converse with learners using natural language. This review contributes to the literature by examining the currently unclear overall effect of using chatbots on language learning performance and comprehensively identifying important study characteristics that affect the overall effectiveness. We meta-analyzed 70 effect sizes from 28 studies, using robust variance estimation. The effects were assessed based on 18 study characteristics about learners, chatbots, learning objectives, context, communication/interaction, and methodological and pedagogical designs. Results indicated that using chatbots produced a positive overall effect on language learning performance (g = 0.486), compared to non-chatbot conditions. Moreover, four characteristics (i.e., educational level, language level, interface design, and interaction capability) affected the overall effectiveness. In an in-depth discussion on how the 18 characteristics are related to the effectiveness, future implications for practice and research are presented.","Wang, Feifei; Cheung, Alan C.

These monolayers prevent the occurrence of undesired electrochemical reactions and act as scaffolds for coupling bioaffinity reagents. Thiols are the most common adlayer used for this application; however, the thiol-gold bond is susceptible to competitive displacement by naturally occurring solvated thiols in biological fluids, as well as to desorption under continuous voltage interrogation. To overcome these issues, N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monolayers have been proposed as an alternative for electrochemical biosensor applications due to the strong carbon-gold bond. To maximize the effectiveness of NHCs for SAMs, a thorough understanding of both the steric effects of wingtip substituents and NHC precursor type to the passivation of electrode surfaces is required. In this study, five different NHC wingtips as well as two kinds of NHC precursors were evaluated. The best performing NHC adlayers can be cycled continuously for four days (over 30,000 voltammetric cycles) without appreciably desorbing from the electrode surface. Benchmark thiol monolayers, in contrast, rapidly desorb after only twelve hours. Investigations also show NHC adlayer formation on other biosensor-relevant electrodes such as platinum and palladium.","Jensen, Isabel M.; Clark, Vincent; Kirby, Harper L.; Arroyo-Curr&aacute;s, Netzahualc&oacute;yotl; Jenkins, David M., 2024, ""Data and code associated with the publication: Tuning N-Heterocyclic Carbene Wingtips to Form Electrochemically Stable Adlayers on Metals."", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/RE5GOK"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/RE5GOK</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2024-08-29T15:44:03Z","JHU Arroyo Laboratory Data Archive","Jensen, Isabel M.; Clark, Vincent; Kirby, Harper L.; Arroyo-Currás, Netzahualcóyotl; Jenkins, David M., 2024, ""Data and code associated with the publication: Tuning N-Heterocyclic Carbene Wingtips to Form Electrochemically Stable Adlayers on Metals."", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/RE5GOK, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",7

Mutations identified in virus sequences obtained from persistently infected patients bear signatures of immune evasion and have some overlap with sequences present in variants of concern. We characterized virus isolates from two COVID-19 patients undergoing immunosuppressive cancer therapy, with all isolates obtained greater than 100 days after the initial COVID-19 diagnoses and compared to an isolate from the start of the infection. Isolates from an individual who never mounted an antibody response specific to SARS-CoV-2 despite the administration of convalescent plasma showed slight reductions in plaque size and some showed temperature-dependent replication attenuation on human nasal epithelial cell culture compared to the virus that initiated infection. An isolate from another patient - who did mount a SARS-CoV-2 IgM response – showed temperature dependent changes in plaque size as well as increased syncytia formation and escape from serum neutralizing antibody. Our results indicate that not all virus isolates from immunocompromised COVID-19 patients display clear signs of phenotypic change but increased attention should be paid to monitoring virus evolution in this patient population.","Wouters, Camille; Sachithanandham, Jaiprasath; Akin, Elgin; Pieterse, Lisa; Fall, Amary; Truong, Thao T.; Bard, Jennifer Dien; Yee, Rebecca; Sullivan, David J.; Mostafa, Heba H.; Pekosz, Andrew, 2024, ""Data and code associated with the publication: SARS-CoV-2 variants from long-term, persistently infected immunocompromised patients have altered syncytia formation, temperature-dependent replication, and escape neutralization with convalescent plasma"", <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/RDLYMJ"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/RDLYMJ</a>, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1","2024-09-13T19:49:27Z","Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository","Wouters, Camille; Sachithanandham, Jaiprasath; Akin, Elgin; Pieterse, Lisa; Fall, Amary; Truong, Thao T.; Bard, Jennifer Dien; Yee, Rebecca; Sullivan, David J.; Mostafa, Heba H.; Pekosz, Andrew, 2024, ""Data and code associated with the publication: SARS-CoV-2 variants from long-term, persistently infected immunocompromised patients have altered syncytia formation, temperature-dependent replication, and escape neutralization with convalescent plasma"", https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/RDLYMJ, Johns Hopkins Research Data Repository, V1",0
