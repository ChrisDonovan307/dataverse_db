The broader goal was guide policy and program interventions that may influence household food security, poverty, and the diets, health and nutrition of pre-school children and their mothers. The PoSHAN surveys were conducted in 21 sub-district units (Village Development Committees, VDCs), in 21 districts, 7 each across the Mountains, Hills and Terai (plains), sampled systematically following a random start. Within each VDC, 3 of 9 wards were systematically sampled, proportional to population size, for a total of 63 wards in the full sample. The PoSHAN surveys were conducted in the same season (~June-August) and wards every year. In addition, 1 VDC, representing an average of the 7 VDCs per zone was surveyed in two additional seasons al (sentinel) surveys to provide year-round agricultural, food security, dietary, nutritional status and other data. The first three were nationally representative (2013, 2014 and 2016) and one was conducted only in the Terai (2015) due to the 2015 Nepal earthquake which mainly affected the Hills and Mountains.

"60","Sedimentary Geobiology Group","https://archive.data.jhu.edu/dataverse/SGG","SGG","The Sedimentary Geobiology Group is a multi-disciplinary group that studies how geochemical and morphological patterns in modern sedimentary systems capture information about ecological diversity (who is there?), biological activity (what are they doing?), and environmental conditions (how do they affect their surroundings and vice versa?). Insights from the modern are then used to interpret geochemical and morphological patterns in the geological record in order to explore the coupled evolution of life and the Earth surface environment.","2024-03-27T13:41:58Z"
"61","ARTIST Simulations","https://archive.data.jhu.edu/dataverse/ArtistSimulations","ArtistSimulations","Codes include simulations used to predict reacted reporter kinetics and dose-response curve of IFN-O1-dART, reacted reporter kinetics, and dose-response curves of the comparator. Eqns S1, S2, are in the Supplementary Information Section 2.1, and Eqn S5 is in Section 2.2. Eqns S9, S10, S11 are in the Supplementary Information Section 6.2. LOD and Sensitivity analysis are in Supplementary Information Section 3. Codes were written and run using Jupyter Notebook.","2024-07-19T14:13:59Z"
