Empowering families to make informed decisions about their loved one’s care is important, but it is unclear how best to communicate prognostic information to vulnerable surrogates when a patient is expected to die. Objective: To test the hypothesis that family members interpret intensivists as being more optimistic when their questions about prognosis are answered indirectly. Design: Between September 27 and October 17, 2019 we conducted a web-based randomized trial of video vignettes depicting an intensivist answering a standardized question about the prognosis of a patient at high risk for death on ICU day 3. Setting: Web-based simulation Participants: National sample of adult children, spouses/partners, or siblings of patients with COPD on long term oxygen therapy. Participants were excluded if they had worked as a doctor, nurse, or advanced practice provider. Intervention: Participants were randomized to view one of 4 intensivist communication styles in response to the question “What do you think is most likely to happen?”: 1) a direct response (control), 2) an indirect response comparing the patient’s condition to other patients, 3) an indirect response describing physiology, or 4) redirection to a discussion of patient values and goals. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participant responses to two questions: 1) “If you had to guess, what do you think the doctor thinks is the chance that your loved one will survive this hospitalization?” and 2) “What do you think are the chances that your loved one will survive this hospitalization?” answered using a 0%-100% probability scale. Results: 302 participants completed the trial, of whom 204 (68%) were female and 165 (55%) were adult children of the patient. Compared to a direct response, participants perceived the intensivist to have a significantly more optimistic prognostic estimate when viewing an indirect response referencing other patients (β=10 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1, 19]; p = 0.03), physiology (β=10 [95% CI 0, 19]; p = 0.04), or redirection to a discussion of patient values and goals (β=19 [95% CI 10, 28]; p < 0.0001). Conclusions and Relevance: Family members interpret indirect responses to questions about prognosis in the ICU setting as more optimistic than direct responses.",2020-04-01 17:02:54,33,2,114,1,2

Typically, this variability is treated as noise, and assumed to cancel out, leaving supposedly stable relationships among behavior, neural activity, and experimental task conditions. Those relationships, however, could change with a participant’s internal cognitive states, and variability in performance may carry important information regarding those states, which cannot be directly measured. Therefore, we used a mathematical, state-space modeling framework to fit internal cognitive states to measured behavioral data, quantifying each participant’s sensitivity to factors such as past errors or distractions, to characterize their underlying fluctuations in reaction time. We show how integrating the states into the modeling framework could help explain trial-by-trial variability in behavior. Further, we identify EEG functional connectivity features that modulate with each state. These results illustrate the potential of this approach and how it could enable the quantification of intra- and inter-individual differences and provide insight into their neural bases. The data and codes contained within this collection can be used to generate the models developed in the paper.",2022-09-12 20:36:56,21,2,NA,NA,2

Background: Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) programs have expanded rapidly, but evaluating their impact on hospital care is challenging. Objectives: To demonstrate how careful study design can reveal POLST’s impact at hospital admission and why analyses of state registry data are unlikely to capture POLST’s effects. Design: Prospective cohort study Setting and Participants: Adult in-patients with Do Not Intubate and/or Do Not Resuscitate (DNR/I) orders in the electronic medical record at the time of discharge from Johns Hopkins Hospital over 18 months. For patients with unplanned readmissions within 30 days, records were reviewed to determine if a Maryland Medical Order for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) form was presented and for the time from readmission to a DNR/I order in the EMR. Analyses were stratified by whether patients could communicate or were accompanied by a proxy at readmission. Results: Among 1,507 patients with DNR/I orders at discharge, 124 (8%) had unplanned readmissions, 112 (90%) could communicate or were accompanied by a proxy at readmission, and 12 (10%) could not communicate and were unaccompanied. For patients who were unaccompanied and could not communicate, MOLST significantly decreased the median time from readmission to DNR/I order (1.2 vs 27.1 hours, P=.001), but this association was greatly attenuated among patients who could communicate or were accompanied by a proxy (16.4 vs 25.4 hours P=.10). Conclusion: Among patients who wanted to avoid intubation and/or CPR, MOLST forms were protective when the patient was unaccompanied by a healthcare proxy at admission and could not communicate. Fewer than 10% of patients met these criteria during unplanned readmissions, and state registry data does not allow this sub-population to be identified.",2019-06-21 13:53:21,14,2,105,1,2

To enable robots to recover from such errors, we draw upon the concept of object permanence—objects remain in existence even when they are not being sensed (e.g., seen) directly. This dataset was created to address the above challenge. The data was collected by having a Kinova Gen3 Robot Arm repeatedly pick up a wooden cube (3cm x 3cm x 3cm) and release the cube 0.3 meters above a table surface. A 7-channel microphone array was used to record the impact sound from when the robot gripper opened to drop the cube. A camera mounted on the robot’s wrist observed the beginning of the cube’s trajectory before the cube bounced out of view, and a ceiling camera recorded the rest of the trajectory.

Parsimonious mathematical models are useful in quantifying parameters related to the pathophysiology of T2D. Here we extend the minimum model developed to describe the glucose-insulin-glucagon dynamics in the isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusion (IIGI) experiment to the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The extended model describes glucose and hormone dynamics in OGTT including the contribution of the incretin hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), to insulin secretion. A new function describing glucose arrival from the gut is introduced. The model is fitted to OGTT data from 8 individuals with T2D and 8 weight-matched controls (CS) without diabetes to obtain parameters related to insulin sensitivity, beta- and alpha-cell function. The parameters, i.e., measures of insulin sensitivity, a1, suppression of glucagon secretion, k1, magnitude of glucagon secretion, γ2, and incretin-dependent insulin secretion, γ3, were found to be different between CS and T2D with p values < .002, < .017, < .009, < .004, respectively. A new rubric for estimating the incretin effect directly from modeling the OGTT is presented. The average incretin effect correlated well with the experimentally determined incretin effect with a Spearman Rank test correlation coefficient of .67 (p < .012). The average incretin effect was found to be different between CS and T2D (p <.032). The developed model is shown to be effective in quantifying the factors relevant to T2D pathophysiology.",2023-12-07 20:11:09,21,5,NA,1,2

We used simulated infiltration through model sand columns to study the impact of colonizing microorganisms on the retention of model colloidal microplastic particles, carboxyl-modified-latex (CML) beads.

The study site consists of 37 contiguous zones; zones are the smallest standard administrative area unit used by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics, with a median size of 0.05km2 within the study area. Case definition: A TB case was defined as any individual with a positive sputum smear or GeneXpert result, sputum culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or documented initiation of TB treatment based on clinical judgment of pulmonary tuberculosis. In this analysis, we included only individuals who were age 15 years or older and residing within the study area; zone of residence was self-reported and verified using landmarks and Google Maps. Case Detection and Enrollment: The study prospectively enrolled TB patients in two phases: a facility-based phase (May 2018-January 2019) and a community-based phase (February-December 2019). In the facility-based phase, we enrolled all consenting adult TB cases who lived in the study area and were passively identified through routine TB diagnostic services at four outpatient TB Diagnosis and Treatment Units located within the study area. In the community-based phase, we attempted to identify all prevalent TB cases in the community through a combination of passive and active case finding activities.

However, the nature of acetylcholine signaling within regions of cholinergic-dependent plasticity and how it changes with experience is poorly understood, much less the impact of amyloidosis on this signaling. Therefore, we optically measure the release profile of acetylcholine to unexpected, predicted, and predictive events in visual cortex (VC)—a site of known cholinergic-dependent plasticity—in a preclinical mouse model of AD that develops amyloidosis. We find that acetylcholine exhibits reinforcement signaling qualities, reporting behaviorally-relevant outcomes and displaying release profiles to predictive and predicted events that change as a consequence of experience. We identify three stages of amyloidosis occurring prior to the degeneration of cholinergic synapses within VC and observe that cholinergic responses in amyloid-bearing mice become impaired over these stages, diverging progressively from age- and sex-matched littermate controls. In particular, amyloidosis degrades signaling of unexpected rewards and punishments, and attenuates the experience-dependent 1) increase of cholinergic responses to outcome predictive visual cues, and 2) decrease of cholinergic responses to predicted outcomes. Hyperactive spontaneous acetylcholine release occurring transiently at the onset of impaired cholinergic signaling is also observed, further implicating disrupted cholinergic activity as an early functional biomarker in AD. Our findings suggest that acetylcholine acts as a reinforcement signal that is impaired by amyloidosis prior to pathological degeneration of the cholinergic system, providing a deeper understanding of the effects of amyloidosis on acetylcholine signaling and informing future interventions for AD.",2023-10-12 07:54:20,24,6,NA,1,2

This finding is surprising since an isolated band of PV is barotropically unstable, a result going back to Rayleigh. Here we investigate the stability of a Mars-like annular vortex using numerical integrations of the rotating shallow water equations. We show how the mode of instability and its growth rate depends upon the latitude and width of the annulus. By introducing thermal relaxation towards an annular equilibrium profile with a time scale similar to that of the instability, we are able to simulate a persistent annular vortex with similar characteristics as that observed in the Martian atmosphere. This time scale, typically 0.5-2 sols, is similar to radiative relaxation time scales for Mars’ polar atmosphere. We also demonstrate that the persistence of an annular vortex is robust to topographic forcing, as long as it is below a certain amplitude. We hence propose that the persistence of this barotropically unstable annular vortex is permitted due to the combination of short radiative relaxation time scales and relatively weak topographic forcing in the Martian polar atmosphere.",2017-02-23 14:12:11,55,14,53,1,2

Much of the research around this topic in the auditory system has centered around human speech perception, in which categorical processes result in an enhanced sensitivity for acoustically meaningful differences and a reduced sensitivity for nonmeaningful distinctions. Much less is known about whether non-human primates process their species-specific vocalizations in a similar manner. We address this question in the common marmoset, a small arboreal New World primate with a rich vocal repertoire produced across a range of behavioral contexts. We first show that marmosets perceptually categorize their vocalizations in ways that correspond to previously defined call types for this species. Next, we show that marmosets are differentially sensitive to changes in particular acoustic features of their most common call types, and that these sensitivity differences are matched to the population statistics of their vocalizations in ways that likely maximize category formation. Finally, we show that marmosets are less sensitive to changes in these acoustic features when within the natural range of variability of their calls, which possibly reflects perceptual specializations which maintain existing call categories. These findings suggest specializations for categorical vocal perception in a New World primate species and pave the way for future studies examining their underlying neural mechanisms.",2023-05-25 17:11:56,87,15,NA,1,2

Our model combines the electron microscopy-based architecture of one MB output neuron (MBON-alpha 3), the synaptic connectivity of its 948 presynaptic Kenyon cells (KCs), and its in vivo membrane properties obtained from patch-clamp recordings. We show that this neuron is electrotonically compact and that synaptic input corresponding to simulated odor input robustly drives its spiking behavior.

"129","doi:10.7281/T1/IHPXXR","Data associated with the publication: Explaining the decay of nucleic acid-based sensors under continuous voltammetric interrogation","https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/IHPXXR","Nucleic acid-based electrochemical sensors (NBEs) can support continuous and highly selective molecular monitoring in biological fluids, in vitro and in vivo, via affinity-based interactions. Such interactions afford a sensing versatility that is not supported by strategies that depend on target-specific reactivity. Thus, NBEs have significantly expanded the scope of molecules that can be monitored continuously in biological systems. However, the technology is limited by the lability of the thiol-based monolayers employed for sensor fabrication. Seeking to understand the main drivers of monolayer degradation, we studied four possible mechanisms of NBEs decay: (i) passive desorption of monolayer elements in undisturbed sensors, (ii) voltage-induced desorption under continuous voltammetric interrogation, (iii) competitive displacement by thiolated molecules naturally present in biofluids like serum, and (iv) protein binding. Our results indicate that voltage-induced desorption of monolayer elements is the main mechanism by which NBEs decay in phosphate-buffered saline. This degradation can be overcome by using a voltage window comprised between -0.2 V and 0.2 V vs Ag|AgCl, reported for the first time in this work, where electrochemical oxygen reduction and surface gold oxidation cannot occur. This result underscores the need for chemically stable redox reporters with more positive reduction potentials than the benchmark methylene blue, and able to cycle thousands of times between redox states to support continuous sensing for long periods. Additionally, in biofluids the rate of sensor decay is further accelerated by the presence of thiolated small molecules like cysteine and glutathione, which can competitively displace monolayer elements even in the absence of voltage-induced damage. We hope that this work will serve as a framework to inspire future development of novel sensor interfaces aiming to eliminate the mechanisms of signal decay in NBEs.",2023-05-15 17:37:25,33,23,NA,1,2

Like other functional RNAs, ribozymes encode a conserved catalytic center supported by peripheral domains that vary among ribozyme sub-families. To understand how core-periphery interactions contribute to ribozyme fitness, we compared the cleavage kinetics of all single base substitutions at 152 sites across the Bacillus subtilis glmS ribozyme by high-throughput sequencing (ClvSeq). The in vitro activity map mirrored phylogenetic sequence conservation in glmS ribozymes, indicating that biological fitness reports all biochemically important positions. The results showed that most deleterious mutations lower activity by impairing ribozyme self-assembly. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the complete ribozyme revealed how individual mutations in the core or the IL4 peripheral loop rewire the network of hydrogen bonds around the catalytic site.

These monolayers prevent the occurrence of undesired electrochemical reactions and act as scaffolds for coupling bioaffinity reagents. Thiols are the most common adlayer used for this application; however, the thiol-gold bond is susceptible to competitive displacement by naturally occurring solvated thiols in biological fluids, as well as to desorption under continuous voltage interrogation. To overcome these issues, N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monolayers have been proposed as an alternative for electrochemical biosensor applications due to the strong carbon-gold bond. To maximize the effectiveness of NHCs for SAMs, a thorough understanding of both the steric effects of wingtip substituents and NHC precursor type to the passivation of electrode surfaces is required. In this study, five different NHC wingtips as well as two kinds of NHC precursors were evaluated.

Mutations identified in virus sequences obtained from persistently infected patients bear signatures of immune evasion and have some overlap with sequences present in variants of concern. We characterized virus isolates from two COVID-19 patients undergoing immunosuppressive cancer therapy, with all isolates obtained greater than 100 days after the initial COVID-19 diagnoses and compared to an isolate from the start of the infection. Isolates from an individual who never mounted an antibody response specific to SARS-CoV-2 despite the administration of convalescent plasma showed slight reductions in plaque size and some showed temperature-dependent replication attenuation on human nasal epithelial cell culture compared to the virus that initiated infection. An isolate from another patient - who did mount a SARS-CoV-2 IgM response – showed temperature dependent changes in plaque size as well as increased syncytia formation and escape from serum neutralizing antibody. Our results indicate that not all virus isolates from immunocompromised COVID-19 patients display clear signs of phenotypic change but increased attention should be paid to monitoring virus evolution in this patient population.",2024-09-13 19:49:27,0,17,NA,1,2

Rhythmic major-element zoning in garnet is a common product of such metamorphism, and one that must record a fundamental subduction process. Here we show that rhythmic major-element zoning in subduction-zone garnets from the Franciscan Complex, California developed in response to growth–dissolution cycles driven by pressure pulses. Using electron probe microanalysis and novel techniques in Raman and synchrotron Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, we demonstrate that at least four such pressure pulses, of magnitude 100–350 MPa, occurred over less than 300,000 years. These pressure magnitude and time scale constraints are most consistent with the garnet zoning having resulted from periodic overpressure development–dissipation cycles, related to pore-fluid pressure fluctuations linked to earthquake cycles. This study demonstrates that some metamorphic reactions can track individual earthquake cycles, and thereby opens new avenues to the study of seismicity.",2017-11-22 19:46:20,28,1,55,1,NA

The charge mobility was enhanced by depositing the pentacene over and between guanine layers and by increasing the proportion of pentacene in the layer-by-layer system, while the current on/off ratio was increased via the decreased off current induced by the guanine layers. The tunable device performance was mainly ascribed to the trap and dopant neutralizing properties of the guanine layers, which would decrease the density of free hydroxyl groups in the OFETs. Furthermore, the cost of the devices could be reduced remarkably via the adoption of the low-cost guanine.",2017-08-16 16:55:31,3,1,30,1,NA

Intentional charging of polymer dielectrics in OFETs can change Vth and affect the bias stress. We describe a chemical design and fabrication protocol to construct multilayer-stack dielectrics for pentacene-based OFETs using different polystyrene (PS)-based polymers in each layer, with oxidizable N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)anilino (TPAOMe)-substituted styrene copolymers in arbitrary vertical positions in the stacks. Thermal, byproduct-free crosslinking of benzocyclobutene subunits provides integrity to the multilayer structure by preventing dissolution of the previous deposited layer. Neutron reflectivity data verified the multilayer morphology. We compared the Vth shift before and after charging the stacks by application of ±100V across 0.5-1 µm total film thicknesses. Bias stress was the dominant effect in bilayer devices with a TPAOMe layer in contact with the pentacene, indicated by the direction of Vth shift associated with either polarity of external electric field. In structures with no TPAOMe subunit in contact with the pentacene, when charging with -100V on top of the source and drain electrodes, electron injection from pentacene to dielectric was the major charging mechanism, again consistent with the bias stress direction. When charging with +100V, bilayer devices without TPAOMe showed little change in Vth, suggesting there was no bias stress effect or charge injection in these devices for this charging polarity. For the bilayer devices with the TPAOMe layer in the bottom, and the trilayer devices with TPOMe in the middle, when +100V was applied, the Vth shifts were opposite those expected from bias stress. Dipole formation or partial ionization of chargeable groups at the interface between the dielectric layers are likely polarization mechanisms in these cases. A simple analytical model supports the plausibility of these mechanisms. This work provides examples of both stabilization and shifting of Vth, and therefore controlling charge carrier density, in semiconductors overlying the dielectric multilayers.",2018-11-19 17:24:44,4,1,16,1,NA

We describe a chemical design and fabrication protocol to construct multilayer-stack dielectrics for pentacene-based OFETs using different polystyrene (PS)-based polymers in each layer, with oxidizable N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)anilino (TPAOMe)-substituted styrene copolymers in arbitrary vertical positions in the stacks.

Neutron reflectivity data verified the multilayer morphology. We compared the Vth shift before and after charging the stacks by application of ±100V across 0.5-1 µm total film thicknesses. Bias stress was the dominant effect in bilayer devices with a TPAOMe layer in contact with the pentacene, indicated by the direction of Vth shift associated with either polarity of external electric field. In structures with no TPAOMe subunit in contact with the pentacene, when charging with -100V on top of the source and drain electrodes, electron injection from pentacene to dielectric was the major charging mechanism, again consistent with the bias stress direction. When charging with +100V, bilayer devices without TPAOMe showed little change in Vth, suggesting there was no bias stress effect or charge injection in these devices for this charging polarity.

Control experiments verified that the electronic effect of the crosslinking was negligible. We found that the TFM substituent markedly and independently affected both the initial threshold voltage Vth and the nonvolatile, shifted Vth observed after the application of static gate voltage, depending on its position adjacent or apart from the pentacene. The trifluoromethyl-bearing polymers exhibited significantly lower magnitude initial threshold voltages (Vth,i of ca. −17 V for P3TFMS compared to −35 V for PS), large threshold voltage shifts after charging by the application of static electric fields (ΔVth of ca. 32 V for P3TFMS and 17 V for PS), and greater stability of the ΔVth under repeated charge/discharge cycles. These results are consistent with P3TFMS having fewer interfacial trap states but more stable bulk trap states. The results are applicable to organo-electronic systems such as piezoelectrics for energy harvesting and nonvolatile OFETs such as memory, sensing, and logic elements.",2019-01-23 20:57:15,6,1,29,1,NA

Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) film doped using various concentrations of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) solutions imposed additional positive potentials on the P3HT RG, resulting in a lower threshold voltage (V_th) on the n-channel silicon FET. Changes in V_th were related to the induced hole concentrations and hole mobility in P3HT films by using our V_th shifting model for the RG FET. We discovered that the electron-donating P3HT and even inorganic materials, indium tin oxide and gold, showed similar electrical potential perturbations dependent on the concentration of F4TCNQ in overlying solutions as the dopant radical anions maximally covered the surfaces. This suggests that there are limited electroactive sites for F4TCNQ binding on electron donor surfaces which results in a similar number of positive charges in film materials forming dipoles with the F4TCNQ radical counteranions. The effect of electron acceptors such as 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane and tetracyanoethylene was compared with that of F4TCNQ in terms of V_th shift using our analytical tool, with differences attributed to acceptor size and reduction potential.

Using remote-gate field-effect transistor characterization of molecular and ionic doping in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and acid-functionalized polythiophene, poly[3-(3-carboxypropyl) thiophene-2,5-diyl] (PT-COOH), we discovered that proton doping effects on the interfacial potential occurring in P3HT could be suppressed by sequentially doping P3HT by 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ). To be specific, intrinsic pH sensitivity shown by pure P3HT (18 mV/pH in a range from pH 3 to 9) was fully dissipated for doped P3HT:F4TCNQ. However, F4TCNQ sequential doping instead increases pH sensitivity of acid-functionalized polythiophene, PT-COOH (40 mV/pH), compared to that of a pure PT-COOH (30 mV/pH). Interactions between polythiophene backbone and side chains, which constrain the activity of COOH, are weakened by stronger F4TCNQ doping leaving behind responsive COOH groups exposed to aqueous solutions. This is supported by the reduced pH sensitivity of PT-COOH sequentially doped by a weaker dopant, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) (21 mV/pH). Thus, doping is shown to stabilize a nonpolar conjugated polymer to pH-induced fluctuations on one hand, and to activate a COOH side chain to pH-induced response on the other.",2021-02-01 15:16:20,2,1,87,1,NA

However, F4TCNQ sequential doping instead increases pH sensitivity of acid-functionalized polythiophene, PT-COOH (40 mV/pH), compared to that of a pure PT-COOH (30 mV/pH). Interactions between polythiophene backbone and side chains, which constrain the activity of COOH, are weakened by stronger F4TCNQ doping leaving behind responsive COOH groups exposed to aqueous solutions. This is supported by the reduced pH sensitivity of PT-COOH sequentially doped by a weaker dopant, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) (21 mV/pH). Thus, doping is shown to stabilize a nonpolar conjugated polymer to pH-induced fluctuations on one hand, and to activate a COOH side chain to pH-induced response on the other.",2021-02-01 15:16:20,2,1,101,1,NA

However, operationalising country ownership to ensure the scale up and sustainability of proven interventions remains elusive at best. To address this challenge, the authors undertook a thematic analysis of interviews collected from representatives of local governments, public health systems, and communities in poor urban areas of East Africa, Francophone West Africa, India, and Nigeria, supported by The Challenge Initiative (TCI), aiming to rapidly and sustainably scale up evidence-based reproductive health and family planning solutions. The main objective of the study was to explore critical elements needed for implementing and scaling evidence-based family planning interventions. The research team conducted thematic analysis of 96 stories collected using the Most Significant Change (MSC) technique between July 2018 and September 2019. After generating 55 unique codes, the codes were grouped into related themes, using TCI’s model as a general analytical framework. Five key themes emerged: (1) strengthening local capacity and improving broader health systems, (2) shifting mindsets of government and community toward local ownership, (3) institutionalizing the interventions within existing government structures, (4) improving data demand and use for better planning of health services, and (5) enhancing coordination of partners. While some themes feature more prominently in a particular region than others, taken together they represent what stakeholders perceive to be essential elements for scaling up locally-driven health programmes in urban areas of Africa and Asia.",2021-05-07 14:09:25,3,1,NA,1,NA

The assembled structures that resulted from the collective formation of β-sheets, π-orbital overlaps, and mineralization resulted in highly interconnected dendritic structures under suitable KOH concentrations. Electrical measurements indicated that when well-interconnected, these dendritic structures maintained conductivities comparable to those of metals at around 1800 S/cm. About 50 mA current was measured for 0.5 V/37.5 μm. Varying the gate voltage in a transistor configuration had no effect on the current levels, indicating a conductive instead of a semiconducting pathway. Control experiments without the peptide, measurements of conductivity over time, and conductivity quenching by ammonia suggested the conductivity of these dendritic networks was derived from proton doping of the central π-electron units in a strong acid environment and was facilitated by closely spaced chromophores, as suggested in the literature, leading to facile π-electron transfer along the interconnected dendritic pathways. Our findings suggest that mineralization templated by appropriate amino acids combined with peptide/π-electron self-assembly can lead to highly conductive dendritic macrostructures as well as control of nanowire growth in specific directions.",2021-07-19 21:01:24,4,1,89,1,NA

Although Lewis acids such as B(C6F5)3have shown promise as dopants for polymers, their doping mechanism is not fully understood. We created 1:1 zwitterionic (including “Wheland-type”) complexes of B(C6F5)3 with conjugated molecules difluorobis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene (diF-TES-ADT) and didodecylthienothiophene (DTT-12) and characterized them with 1H NMR, UV−vis spectroscopy, EPR spectroscopy, optical and scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and X-ray diffraction. We employed these complexes as p-dopants for three conjugated polymers and established their doping abilities by conductivity measurements, Seebeck studies, field effect transistor (FET), and remote-gate sensing (RG-FET) measurements. Conductivity changes were dependent on the conjugated molecule adduct component, consistent with the adduct itself serving as the oxidant. The adduct complexes were capable of inducing changes in the surface potential of spun polymer films similar to the behavior shown by conventional dopants. Charge carrier density calculations by remote gate sensing revealed that these adducts can generate holes. We also studied the effect of adding the B(C6F5)3 first, followed by addition of the neat conjugated molecules; the observation of behavior that was different from that using preformed adducts was consistent with the adducts remaining intact during doping. When B(C6F5)3 was added to the polymers, followed by uncomplexed conjugated molecules, the generated hole carrier density is lower than that generated by the B(C6F5)3 dopant but often greater than that generated by the Wheland complexes, indicating a high probability of adduct formation in this case. Density functional theory calculations show that adduct formation between boranes and the conjugated molecules and segments of the polymers is energetically favorable and that some charge transfer between adducts and neutral polymers is plausible if Coulombic and entropic effects are taken into consideration. Thus, such adducts can be considered as possible doping sites for conjugated polymers.",2022-06-17 19:59:53,4,1,76,1,NA

The adduct complexes were capable of inducing changes in the surface potential of spun polymer films similar to the behavior shown by conventional dopants. Charge carrier density calculations by remote gate sensing revealed that these adducts can generate holes. We also studied the effect of adding the B(C6F5)3 first, followed by addition of the neat conjugated molecules; the observation of behavior that was different from that using preformed adducts was consistent with the adducts remaining intact during doping. When B(C6F5)3 was added to the polymers, followed by uncomplexed conjugated molecules, the generated hole carrier density is lower than that generated by the B(C6F5)3 dopant but often greater than that generated by the Wheland complexes, indicating a high probability of adduct formation in this case. Density functional theory calculations show that adduct formation between boranes and the conjugated molecules and segments of the polymers is energetically favorable and that some charge transfer between adducts and neutral polymers is plausible if Coulombic and entropic effects are taken into consideration. Thus, such adducts can be considered as possible doping sites for conjugated polymers.",2022-06-17 19:59:53,4,1,96,1,NA

This was a retrospective observational cohort study of remnant clinical specimens from patients who visited acute care hospitals within the Johns Hopkins Health System (JHHS) in the Baltimore, MD-Washington, DC area between October 2020-May 2022. Participants included confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant people and matched non-pregnant people (matching criteria included age, race/ethnicity, area deprivation index, insurance status, and vaccination status to ensure matched demographics). The primary dependent measures were clinical COVID-19 outcomes, infectious virus recovery, viral RNA levels, and mucosal anti-spike (S) IgG titers from upper respiratory tract samples. A total of 452 individuals (117 pregnant and 335 non-pregnant) were included in the study, with both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals represented. Pregnant patients were at increased risk of hospitalization (OR = 4.2; CI = 2.0-8.6), intensive care unit admittance (OR = 4.5; CI = 1.2-14.2), and of being placed on supplemental oxygen therapy (OR = 3.1; CI =1.3-6.9). Individuals infected during their 3rd trimester had higher mucosal anti-S IgG titers and lower viral RNA levels (P< 0.05) than those infected during their 1st or 2nd trimesters. Pregnant individuals experiencing breakthrough infections due to the Omicron variant had reduced anti-S IgG compared to non-pregnant patients (P< 0.05). The observed increased severity of COVID-19 and reduced mucosal antibody responses particularly among pregnant participants infected with the omicron variant suggest that maintaining high levels of SARS-CoV-2 immunity through booster vaccines may be important for protection of this at-risk population.",2024-02-28 12:19:18,6,1,NA,1,NA

Access is a key determinant of ITN use but it is not the only one; prior studies have identified individual, household, and community level factors that affect ITN use. However, studies have generally not assessed the psychosocial or ideational determinants of ITN use. Using 2014 household survey data, this manuscript examines the socio-demographic, ideational, household, and community factors associated with household member use of ITNs in Liberia. Multilevel modeling was used to assess fixed effects at the individual, household, and community levels, and random effects at the household and cluster levels. The data showed significant residual clustering at the household level, indicating that there were unmeasured factors operating at this level that are associated with ITN use. Age, sex, number of ITNs in household, and female caregiver’s perceived severity of malaria, perceived self-efficacy to detect a complicated case of malaria, and exposure to the ‘Take Cover’ communication campaign were positively associated with ITN use by members of her household. The association with household size was negative.",2016-07-14,34,2,15,1,NA

We used a literature-informed strategy to develop the Consumerist Attitudes towards Healthcare Scale, drawing items from related scales if these items represented the construct of consumerism. We conducted a targeted literature search to identify conceptual models that describe the patient as a consumer of healthcare. We also identified existing scales and questionnaires as a supply of items for inclusion. From the identified literature, we extracted a list of attitudes, preferences, and expectations for inclusion in our initial survey. We surveyed a nationally representative US population with a 45 item questionnaire that used 5-point Likert responses to assess consumeristic attitudes. We generated a polychoric correlation matrix and did exploratory factor analysis using a principal components solution. We sent the resulting scale to additional respondents twice for repeatability testing. We then surveyed a new nationally representative population with this consumeristic attitudes scale plus 2 additional existent scales for testing of concordance and discordance.

The influence of these groups on dielectric function, charge retention and threshold voltage shifts (ΔVth) depending on their positions in dielectric multilayers was determined. We compared the observations made on an N-perphenylated iminobisaniline side chain with those from the same side chains modified with ZnO nanoparticles and with an adduct formed from tetracyanoethylene (TCNE). We also synthesized an analogue in which six methoxy groups are present instead of two amine nitrogens. At 6 mol % side chain, hopping transport was sufficient to cause shorting of the gate, while at 2 mol %, charge trapping was observable as transistor threshold voltage shifts (ΔVth). We created three types of devices: with the substituted PS layer as single layer dielectric, on top of a crosslinked PS layer but in contact with the pentacene (bilayers), and sandwiched between two PS layers in trilayers. Particularly large bias stress effects and ΔVth, larger than the hexamethoxy and previously studied dimethoxy analogs, were observed in the second case and the effects increased with the increasing electron donating properties of the modified side chains. The highest ΔVth was consistent with a majority of the side chains stabilizing trapped charge. Trilayer devices showed decreased charge storage capability compared to previous work in which we used less donating side chains but in higher concentrations. The ZnO and TCNE modifications resulted in slightly more and less negative ΔVth, respectively, when the side chain polystyrene was not in contact with the pentacene and isolated from the gate electrode.

Its multi-system nature has made animal modeling difficult, but recent efforts combining diet-induced obesity and hemodynamic stress are popular: mouse - L-NAME/high-fat diet (HFD), the ZSF1 rat which combines leptin deficiency with genetic-based diabetes, hypertensive and heart failure phenotypes, and an obese/hypertensive Göttingen minipig. We have reported that human HFpEF myocytes particular from patients who are obese display a profound reduction in systolic Ca2+-activated tension, that is negatively correlated with body mass index (Circulation. 2021;143:965–967). Here we tested whether such deficits are found in these three HFpEF animal models. Of the three models, we only find a change in systolic level calcium activated tension in the Göttingen minipig. The mouse and rat models show results that are superimposable with their respective controls. The data are from permeabilized myocytes obtained from the heart tissue for each model and respective controls. The data file provides the raw data for myocyte cross section area, measured force at fixed sarcomere length (2.1 µ), and then the different calcium concentrations used.",2024-03-18 18:32:52,5,2,NA,1,NA

It has been shown that many neurons in the macaque visual cortex signal border-ownership in displays of simple geometric shapes such as squares, but how well these neurons resolve border-ownership in natural scenes is not known. We studied area V2 neurons in behaving macaques with static images of complex natural scenes. We found that about half of the neurons were border-ownership selective for contours in natural scenes and this selectivity originated from the image context. The border-ownership signals emerged within 70 ms after stimulus onset, only ~ 30 ms after response onset. A substantial fraction of neurons were highly consistent across scenes. Thus, the cortical mechanisms of figure-ground organization are fast and efficient even in images of complex natural scenes. Understanding how the brain performs this task so fast remains a challenge.",2017-08-22 12:23:07,53,2,32,1,NA

Therapeutic options for managing preterm birth are generally unavailable for 98% of the almost 15 million preterm babies born each year, and the evidence base for preventative interventions is lacking. One area that has been substantially neglected in developing countries is the role that poor oral health may play raising the likelihood of early spontaneous delivery. There is epidemiologic and microbiologic evidence for an association between maternal periodontal disease and preterm birth, however, causal mechanisms are not fully understood, and results from randomized trials intervening on mothers with periodontal therapies to reduce prematurity have been mixed. In 2014, we initiated a community-based project to examine this question in a high burden setting with low levels of confounding risk factors. Sarlahi District in southern Nepal fit this description, with high rates of neonatal mortality (28 / 1,000 live births), preterm birth (17%), low birth weight (30%), poor oral health, and low rates of smoking, alcohol use, and chronic diseases. The overall objective of our study was to assess the epidemiologic relationship between periodontal disease and preterm birth and investigate causal mechanisms on the pathway from oral infection to early spontaneous delivery. Our specific aims included the following: 1. Assess the incidence of preterm birth among women with / without periodontitis 2. Examine relationships between causal mechanisms, specifically clinical signs of periodontitis, subgingival biofilm composition, and levels of inflammatory mediators in gingival crevicular fluid and serum 3. Conduct a small pilot trial to estimate the association between adherence to a 0.12% chlorhexidine (non-alcohol) daily mouthrinse and subgingival biofilm composition and levels of inflammatory mediators in gingival crevicular fluid and serum 4.

Information about the concentration of frail individuals is expected to be valuable to health departments and other organizations with resources to deploy such as shelter, hospital beds, and ventilators. Additionally, researchers benefit from granular measures of frailty in communities for health services research or community-based research. We aimed to generate the probability of frailty for 100% of U.S. Medicare beneficiaries in the U.S. using a claims-based frailty index and describe the regional prevalence of frailty. We used a cross-sectional design using data from April through October 2015. We included 100% of Medicare beneficiaries with parts A and B coverage (n= 31,609,883) and calculated the probability of frailty using a validated claims-based frailty index. We report the prevalence of frail adults within each census division, state, county and U.S. zip code as the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries with a frailty probability greater than 20%. This dataset is our estimate of the percent of frail individuals (in 2015) for each zip code and county in the U.S. We anticipate this data set is useful for health services researchers and for individuals planning services.

All archival documents cited in the database come from records held in the Historical Archives of Goa (HAG), the state archive of Goa based in Panaji. The archive, which was founded in 1595 under Viceroy Matias de Albuquerque (1547-1609) and the first appointed archivist and chronicler, Diogo de Couto (1542/43-1616), contains an invaluable collection of municipal records from the Senado de Goa or Goan Municipal Council, including thousands of medical licensing records. The database described here contains only records from the first 150 years of extant medical licensing records, leaving space for future researchers to expand and improve the database to include later records.",2022-05-17 19:45:56,2271,4,NA,1,NA

These processes require that EPCs break down the extracellular matrix (ECM), migrate, differentiate and undergo tube morphogenesis. Evidently, the ECM plays a critical role by providing biochemical and biophysical cues that regulate cellular behaviour. Using a chemically and mechanically tunable hydrogel to study tube morphogenesis in vitro, we show that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and substrate mechanics co-regulate tubulogenesis of EPCs. High levels of VEGF are required to initiate tube morphogenesis and activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which enable EPC migration. Under these conditions, the elasticity of the substrate affects the progression of tube morphogenesis. With decreases in substrate stiffness, we observe decreased MMP expression while increased cellular elongation, with intracel lular vacuole extension and coalescence to open lumen compartments. RNAi studies demonstrate that membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP) is required to enable the movement of EPCs on the matrix and that EPCs sense matrix stiffness through signalling cascades leading to the activation of the RhoGTPase Cdc42. Collectively, these results suggest that coupled responses for VEGF stimulation and modulation of substrate stiffness are required to regulate tube morphogenesis of EPCs.

The extracellular matrix provides a structural platform for endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to differentiate and assemble into a tubular structure. We demonstrate that optimized, patterned fibronectin surfaces guide the ordered adhesion of human EPCs, maintain EPC responsiveness to tumor necrosis factor-α, support their elongation along the culture period, and enhance vo n Willebrand factor expression. Using fibrin gel as the three-dimensional milieu allows the assembly of unidirectional chains and formation of tubular structures. High-resolution analysis shows a distinctive lumen, as well as numerous Weibel Palade bodies and caveolae, all indicating a typical progression in vascular morphogenesis and the angiogenic process. Altogether, this approach allows us to engineer the formation of well-organized vascular structures in vitro.",2015-08-25,26,5,46,1,NA

Evaluations of loads by season revealed N, P, and SS load magnitudes have been highest in January-March and lowest in July-September, but the temporal trends have followed similar decadal-scale patterns in all seasons, with notable exceptions. Generally, total N (TN) load has dropped since the late 1980s, but particulate nutrients and SS have risen since the mid-1990s. The majority of these rises were from Susquehanna River and relate to diminished net trapping at the Conowingo Reservoir. Substantial rises in SS were also observed, however, in other rivers. Moreover, the summed rise in particulate P load from other rivers is of similar magnitude as from Susquehanna. Dissolved nutrient loads have dropped in the upland (Piedmont and above) rivers, but risen in two small rivers in the Coastal Plain affected by lagged groundwater input. In addition, analysis of fractional contributions revealed consistent N trends across the upland watersheds.

Here we present a comprehensive evaluation of nutrient and sediment loads over the last three decades at multiple locations in the Susquehanna River basin (SRB), Chesapeake's largest tributary watershed. Sediment and nutrient riverine loadings, including both dissolved and particulate fractions, have generally declined at all sites upstream of Conowingo Dam (non-tidal SRB outlet). Period-of-record declines in riverine yield are generally smaller than those in source input, suggesting the possibility of legacy contributions. Consistent with other watershed studies, these results reinforce the importance of considering lag time between the implementation of management actions and achievement of river quality improvement. Whereas flow-normalized loadings for particulate species have increased recently below Conowingo Reservoir, those for upstream sites have declined, thus substantiating conclusions from prior studies about decreased reservoir trapping efficiency. In regard to streamflow effects, statistically significant log-linear relationships between annual streamflow and annual constituent load suggest the dominance of hydrological control on the inter-annual variability of constituent export. Concentration-discharge relationships revealed general chemostasis and mobilization effects for dissolved and particulate species, respectively, both suggesting transport-limitation conditions. In addition to affecting annual export rates, streamflow has also modulated the relative importance of dissolved and particulate fractions, as reflected by its negative correlations with dissolved P/total P, dissolved N/total N, particulate P/SS, and total N/total P ratios. For land-use effects, period-of-record median annual yields of N, P, and SS all correlate positively with the area fraction of non-forested land but negatively with that of forested land under all hydrological conditions.

Until 2020, two genetic lineages of influenza B virus – Yamagata and Victoria – circulated in the population. These lineages are antigenically distinct but differences in virus replication or the induction of host cell responses after infection have not been carefully studied. Recent IBV clinical isolates of both lineages were obtained from influenza surveillance efforts of the Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence in Influenza Research and Response and characterized in vitro. B/Victoria and B/Yamagata clinical isolates were recognized less efficiently by serum from influenza-vaccinated individuals in comparison to the vaccine strains. B/Victoria lineages formed smaller plaques on MDCK cells compared to B/Yamagata, but infectious virus production in primary human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures showed no differences. While ciliated epithelial cells were the dominant cell type infected by both lineages, B/Victoria lineages had a slight preference for MUC5AC-positive cells, while B/Yamagata lineages infected more basal cells. Finally, while both lineages induced a strong interferon response 48 hours after infection of hNEC cultures, the B/Victoria lineages showed a much stronger induction of interferon related signaling pathways compared to B/Yamagata. This demonstrates that the two influenza B virus lineages differ not only in their antigenic structure but in their ability to induce host innate immune responses.",2023-10-20 13:46:16,19,5,NA,1,NA

To evaluate the progress of management actions in the Bay's largest tributary, the Susquehanna River, we analyzed the long-term seasonal trends of flow-normalized N, P, and SS load over the last two to three decades, both above and below the Lower Susquehanna River Reservoir System. Our results indicate that annual and decadal-scale trends of nutrient and sediment load generally followed similar patterns in all four seasons, implying that changes in watershed function and land use had similar impacts on nutrient and sediment load at all times of the year. Above the reservoir system, the combined loads from the Marietta and Conestoga Stations indicate general trends of N, P, and SS reduction in the Susquehanna River Basin, which can most likely be attributed to a suite of management actions on point, agricultural, and stormwater sources. In contrast, upward trends of SS and particulate-associated P and N were generally observed below the Conowingo Reservoir since the mid-1990s. Our analyses suggest that (1) the reservoirs' capacity to trap these materials has been diminishing over the past two to three decades, and especially so for SS and P since the mid-1990s, and that (2) the Conowingo Reservoir has already neared its sediment storage capacity. These changes in reservoir performance will pose significant new kinds of challenges to attainment of total maximum daily load goals for the Susquehanna River Basin, and particularly if also accompanied by increases in storm frequency and intensity due to climate change. Accordingly, the reservoir issue may need to be factored into the proper establishment of regulatory load requirements and the development of watershed implementation plans.

Our analyses suggest that (1) the reservoirs' capacity to trap these materials has been diminishing over the past two to three decades, and especially so for SS and P since the mid-1990s, and that (2) the Conowingo Reservoir has already neared its sediment storage capacity. These changes in reservoir performance will pose significant new kinds of challenges to attainment of total maximum daily load goals for the Susquehanna River Basin, and particularly if also accompanied by increases in storm frequency and intensity due to climate change. Accordingly, the reservoir issue may need to be factored into the proper establishment of regulatory load requirements and the development of watershed implementation plans.

To evaluate the progress of management actions in the Bay's largest tributary, the Susquehanna River, we analyzed the long-term seasonal trends of flow-normalized N, P, and SS load over the last two to three decades, both above and below the Lower Susquehanna River Reservoir System. Our results indicate that annual and decadal-scale trends of nutrient and sediment load generally followed similar patterns in all four seasons, implying that changes in watershed function and land use had similar impacts on nutrient and sediment load at all times of the year.

We compare two models, one with and one without CDMs, and show that their presence leads to an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle over coastal and northern subpolar regions, which may exceed 2°C. The size and sign of the change are controlled by the interplay between enhanced shortwave heating of the surface, shading and cooling of the subsurface and the extent to which these are connected by vertical mixing. The changes in the seasonal cycle largely explain changes in the range of temperature extremes, an aspect of climate with important implications for ecosystem cycling. The modeled changes associated with CDMs have an intriguing resemblance to the observed trend in the annual cycle seen in recent decades, suggesting that more attention be paid to the role of “ocean yellowing” in global change.",2019-01-23 14:37:33,24,6,NA,1,NA

Finally, we examined the kinetics of EC adhesion and spreading on the soft PDMS substrates compared to the stiff SiO2 substrates. Culturing cells on the PDMS substrates demonstrated an enhanced EC elongation and alignment when compared to stiff SiO2 with similar topographical features.

It can impair decision-making and is a prominent feature of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We propose that evaluation of doubt during decision-making provides a useful endophenotype with which to study the underlying pathophysiology of OCD and potentially other psychopathologies. For the current study, we developed a new instrument, the Doubt Questionnaire, to clinically assess doubt, and evaluated its psychometric properties. The random dot motion task was used to measure reaction time and subjective certainty, at varying levels of perceptual difficulty, in individuals who scored high and low on doubt, and in individuals with and without OCD. We found that doubt scores were significantly higher in OCD cases than controls. Drift diffusion modeling revealed that high doubt scores predicted slower evidence accumulation than did low doubt scores; and OCD diagnosis lower than controls. At higher levels of dot coherence, OCD participants exhibited significantly slower drift rates than did controls. In addition, at higher levels of coherence, high doubt subjects exhibited even slower drift rates and reaction times than low doubt subjects. Moreover, under high coherence conditions, individuals with high doubt scores reported lower certainty in their decisions than did those with low doubt scores. We conclude that the Doubt Questionnaire is a useful instrument for measuring doubt. Compared to those with low doubt, those with high doubt accumulate evidence more slowly and report lower certainty when making decisions under conditions of low uncertainty. High doubt may affect the decision-making process in individuals with OCD. The dimensional doubt measure is a useful endophenotype for OCD research and could enable computationally rigorous and neurally valid understanding of decision-making and its pathological expression in OCD and other disorders.",2019-07-10 18:25:43,168,7,NA,1,NA

Here, we demonstrate in mouse models of metastatic breast cancer that IONPs can alter the host immune landscape leading to systemic immune-mediated disease suppression. We report that a single intravenous injection of IONPs can inhibit primary tumor growth, suppress metastases, and extend survival. Gene expression analysis revealed activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways involving signaling via Toll/Interleukin-1 Receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β (TRIF), a TLR pathway adaptor protein. Requisite participation of TRIF in suppressing tumor progression was demonstrated with histopathologic evidence of upregulated IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a downstream protein, and confirmed in a TRIF knockout syngeneic mouse model of metastatic breast cancer. Neither starch-coated polystyrene nanoparticles lacking iron, nor iron-containing dextran-coated parenteral iron replacement agent, induced significant antitumor effects suggesting a dependence on the type of IONP formulation. Analysis of multiple independent clinical databases support a hypothesis that upregulation of TLR3 and IRF3 correlates with increased overall survival among breast cancer patients. Taken together, these data support a compelling rationale to re-examine IONP formulations as harboring anti-cancer immune (nano)adjuvant properties to generate therapeutic benefit without requiring uptake by cancer cells.",2024-05-02 20:09:40,25,8,NA,1,NA

Active sensing can facilitate this process by engaging motor systems in the sampling of sensory information. The echolocating bat serves as an excellent model to investigate the coupling between action and sensing, because it adaptively controls both the acoustic signals used to probe the environment, and movements to receive echoes at the auditory periphery. We report here that the echolocating bat controls the features of its sonar vocalizations in tandem with the positioning of the outer ears to maximize acoustic cues for target detection and localization. The bat’s adaptive control of sonar vocalizations and ear positioning occurs on a millisecond time-scale to capture spatial information from arriving echoes, as well as on a longer time-scale, to track target movement. Our results demonstrate that purposeful control over sound production and reception can serve to improve acoustic cues for localization tasks. This finding also highlights the general importance of movement to sensory processing across animal species. Finally, our discoveries point to important parallels between spatial perception by echolocation and vision.",2016-09-08,127,10,33,1,NA

This book examines how the civic legacies of past struggles for democracy shape current movements for immigrant rights. Examining three industrial democracies in Northeast Asia with overlapping immigration and citizenship policies, immigrant populations, and immigration histories, this book offers insights into the gaps between state policies and immigrant political behavior across similarly situated countries. In addition to comparing policy reforms, state-institutionalized rights for migrants, and immigrant incorporation policies, programs, and services, this project seeks to better understand the process of political incorporation through the lens of migrants themselves. In order to understand the incentives and disincentives for particular forms of political engagement as well as immigrant strategies for political empowerment, the methods employed must allow the respondents to generate their own questions, concepts, and categorizations. In addition to Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese government publications and archival materials, the project relies on a combination of questionnaires, over 150 in-depth interviews with immigrants, pro-immigrant activists, and government officials, and 28 focus groups with immigrant communities in the three countries. The Immigrant Incorporation in East Asian Democracies (IIEAD) Project contains the focus group data associated with this book. In Japan, the focus groups consisted of migrants from the Korean peninsula, mainland China, the Philippines, Brazil, Peru, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia; in Korea, participants were nationals of mainland China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Mongolia, and Myanmar; and, in Taiwan, participants consisted of migrants from Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines.

The spatial pattern of change provides a “fingerprint” that is generally much larger than natural variability. Insofar as the response to radiative forcing is linear (the impact of quadrupling CO2 is twice the impact of doubling CO2) this fingerprint can then be used to estimate the impact of historical greenhouse gas forcing. However the degree to which biogeochemical cycles respond linearly to radiative forcing has rarely been tested. In this paper, we evaluate which ocean biogeochemical fields are likely to respond linearly to changing radiative forcing, which ones do not, and where linearity breaks down. We also demonstrate that the representation of lateral mixing by mesoscale eddies, which varies significantly across climate models, plays an important role in modulating the breakdown of linearity. Globally integrated surface rates of biogeochemical cycling (primary productivity, particulate export) respond in a relatively linear fashion and can be moderately sensitive to mixing. By contrast, the habitability of the interior ocean (as determined by hypoxia and calcite supersaturation) behaves nonlinearly and is very sensitive to mixing. This is because the deep ocean, as well as certain regions in the surface ocean, are very sensitive to the magnitude of deep wintertime convection.

This book examines how the civic legacies of past struggles for democracy shape current movements for immigrant rights. Examining three industrial democracies in Northeast Asia with overlapping immigration and citizenship policies, immigrant populations, and immigration histories, this book offers insights into the gaps between state policies and immigrant political behavior across similarly situated countries. In addition to comparing policy reforms, state-institutionalized rights for migrants, and immigrant incorporation policies, programs, and services, this project seeks to better understand the process of political incorporation through the lens of migrants themselves. In order to understand the incentives and disincentives for particular forms of political engagement as well as immigrant strategies for political empowerment, the methods employed must allow the respondents to generate their own questions, concepts, and categorizations. In addition to Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese government publications and archival materials, the project relies on a combination of questionnaires, over 150 in-depth interviews with immigrants, pro-immigrant activists, and government officials, and 28 focus groups with immigrant communities in the three countries. The Immigrant Incorporation in East Asian Democracies (IIEAD) Project contains the focus group data associated with this book. In Japan, the focus groups consisted of migrants from the Korean peninsula, mainland China, the Philippines, Brazil, Peru, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia; in Korea, participants were nationals of mainland China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Mongolia, and Myanmar; and, in Taiwan, participants consisted of migrants from Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines.

This book examines how the civic legacies of past struggles for democracy shape current movements for immigrant rights. Examining three industrial democracies in Northeast Asia with overlapping immigration and citizenship policies, immigrant populations, and immigration histories, this book offers insights into the gaps between state policies and immigrant political behavior across similarly situated countries. In addition to comparing policy reforms, state-institutionalized rights for migrants, and immigrant incorporation policies, programs, and services, this project seeks to better understand the process of political incorporation through the lens of migrants themselves. In order to understand the incentives and disincentives for particular forms of political engagement as well as immigrant strategies for political empowerment, the methods employed must allow the respondents to generate their own questions, concepts, and categorizations. In addition to Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese government publications and archival materials, the project relies on a combination of questionnaires, over 150 in-depth interviews with immigrants, pro-immigrant activists, and government officials, and 28 focus groups with immigrant communities in the three countries. The Immigrant Incorporation in East Asian Democracies (IIEAD) Project contains the focus group data associated with this book. In Japan, the focus groups consisted of migrants from the Korean peninsula, mainland China, the Philippines, Brazil, Peru, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia; in Korea, participants were nationals of mainland China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Mongolia, and Myanmar; and, in Taiwan, participants consisted of migrants from Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines.

We observed no evidence of toxicity at doses up to 25 mg Fe/mouse, five-fold higher than those used in subsequent in vivo experiments. Although DCs cultured with BP revealed high levels of nanoparticle uptake, neither JAWSII dendritic cells nor bone marrow derived cells (BMDCs) showed significant changes in marker expression. To assess whether BP interactions in vivo produced different effects, we analyzed CD80, CD86, and MHC II expression of DCs recovered from the livers, spleens, bone marrows, and lymph nodes of mice injected once with BP (5 mg Fe). Interestingly, only DCs in spleens and bone marrows responded to BP exposure. DCs recovered from other tissues and organs showed no evidence of increased activation. These findings highlight complex effects with systemic exposure to nanoparticles, and their potential to mediate specific and selective activation of innate immune cells, which depends on the tissue site and features of the extracellular environment.

However, no apparent mutations were identified in the HA gene segment of dominant H3N2 viruses, and the severity of the season could not be solely attributed to a vaccine mismatch. Clinical samples from the Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance network during the 2016-17 and 2017-18 influenza seasons were sequenced to target influenza A virus. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on viral whole genome sequences. Representative viral isolates of the two seasons were characterized in immortalized cell lines and human nasal epithelial cell cultures, and demographic data and clinical outcomes of patients were analyzed. Unique H3N2 reassortment events were observed, resulting in two predominant strains in the 2017-18 season: HA clade 3C.2a2 and clade 3C.3a, which had novel gene segment constellations containing gene segments from HA clade 3C.2a1 viruses. The reassortant re3C.2a2 viruses replicated with faster kinetics and to a higher peak titer compared to the parental 3C.2a2 and 3C.2a1 viruses, which may have contributed to the increased severity. The reassortant re3C.3a was able to infect an older population more effectively compared to the parental 3C.3a, perhaps through evasion of preexisting NA antibodies. Our findings suggest that the increased severity of the 2017-18 influenza season was due in part to two intrasubtypes, co-circulating H3N2 reassortant viruses with fitness advantages over the parental viruses.

However, changes in convection and surface temperatures produce changes in winds that do produce a much larger change in the density structure which is then reflected in the Circumpolar Current strength.

We previously characterized OOR responses of normal chinchillas to whole-body tilt and translation and to prosthetic electrical stimulation targeting the utricle and saccule via electrodes implanted in otherwise normal ears. Here we extend that work to examine OOR responses to tilt and translation stimuli after unilateral intratympanic gentamicin injection and to natural/mechanical and prosthetic/electrical stimulation delivered separately or in combination to animals with bilateral vestibular hypofunction after right ear intratympanic gentamicin injection followed by surgical disruption of the left labyrinth at the time of electrode implantation. Unilateral intratympanic gentamicin injection decreased natural OOR response magnitude to about half of normal, without markedly changing OOR response direction or symmetry. Subsequent surgical disruption of the contralateral labyrinth at the time of electrode implantation surgery further decreased OOR magnitude during natural stimulation, consistent with bimodal-bilateral otolith end organ hypofunction (ototoxic on the right ear, surgical on the left ear). Delivery of pulse-frequency- or pulse-amplitude-modulated prosthetic/electrical stimulation targeting the left utricle and saccule in phase with whole-body tilt and translation motion stimuli yielded responses closer to normal than the deficient OOR responses of those same animals in response to head tilt and translation alone.",2024-01-09 16:15:38,124,59,139,2,NA

We previously created an Overuse Index that uses billing codes for diverse clinical services that act as indicators to reflect the latent tendency of a region to overuse health care resources relative to other regions. We newly operationalized our approach to first measure overuse among Medicare beneficiaries within hospitals and their associated outpatient clinics, before we apply the model to generate the Overuse Index at the levels of interest (health systems, regions, or states.) We accessed 100% of the inpatient and outpatient claims, and the Master Beneficiary Summary files of Medicare beneficiaries from July 2015 through December 2018 through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) Virtual Research Data Center (VRDC). Seventeen indicator procedures contributed to the Overuse Index. This set included five new indicators compared to our earlier work. We ran a model across the 17 indicators with fixed effects for states, indictors, and year-quarter; hospital-level random effects, and hospital-level patient characteristics. The fixed effects for the states are the Overuse Index for that state, and represent the tendency for state-wide overuse of healthcare relative to the average state. This was then normalized so the average is 0 with a S.D. of 1.",2021-09-09 17:10:19,138,3,133,3,NA

From the publication abstract: Two donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers are obtained by coupling difluoro‐ and dichloro‐substituted forms of the electron‐deficient unit BDOPV and the relatively weak donor moiety dichlorodithienylethene (ClTVT). The conductivity and power factors of doped devices are different for the chlorinated and fluorinated BDOPV polymers. A high electron conductivity of 38.3 and 16.1 S cm−1 are obtained from the chlorinated and fluorinated polymers with N‐DMBI, respectively, and 12.4 and 2.4 S cm−1 are obtained from the chlorinated and fluorinated polymers with CoCp2, respectively, from drop‐cast devices. The corresponding power factors are 22.7, 7.6, 39.5, and 8.0 µW m−1 K−2, respectively. Doping of PClClTVT with N‐DMBI results in excellent air stability; the electron conductivity of devices with 50 mol% N‐DMBI as dopant remained up to 4.9 S m−1 after 222 days in the air, the longest for an n‐doped polymer stored in air, with a thermoelectric power factor of 9.3 µW m−1 K−2.

A high electron conductivity of 38.3 and 16.1 S cm−1 are obtained from the chlorinated and fluorinated polymers with N‐DMBI, respectively, and 12.4 and 2.4 S cm−1 are obtained from the chlorinated and fluorinated polymers with CoCp2, respectively, from drop‐cast devices. The corresponding power factors are 22.7, 7.6, 39.5, and 8.0 µW m−1 K−2, respectively. Doping of PClClTVT with N‐DMBI results in excellent air stability; the electron conductivity of devices with 50 mol% N‐DMBI as dopant remained up to 4.9 S m−1 after 222 days in the air, the longest for an n‐doped polymer stored in air, with a thermoelectric power factor of 9.3 µW m−1 K−2. However, the conductivity of PFClTVT‐based devices can hardly be measured after 103 days. These observations are consistent with morphologies determined by grazing incidence wide angle X‐ray scattering and atomic force microscopy.",2021-02-22 21:23:35,5,1,101,NA,NA

From the abstract: The development of high-performance-conjugated polymer-based gas sensors involves detailed structural tailoring such that high sensitivities are achieved without compromising the stability of the fabricated devices. In this work, we systematically developed a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymer semiconductors by modifying the polymer backbone to achieve and rationalize enhancements in gas sensitivities and electronic stability in air. NO2- and NH3-responsive polymer-based organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are described with improved air stability compared to all-thiophene conjugated polymers. Five DPP–fluorene-based polymers were synthesized and compared to two control polymers and used as active layers to detect a concentration of NO2 at least as low as 0.5 ppm. The hypothesis that the less electron-donating fluorene main-chain subunit would lead to increased signal/drift compared to thiophene and carbazole subunits was tested. The sensitivities exhibited a bias voltage-dependent behavior. The proportional on-current change of OFETs using a dithienyl DPP–fluorene polymer reached ∼614% for an exposure to 20 ppm of NO2 for 5 min, testing at a bias voltage of −33 V, among the higher reported NO2 sensitivities for conjugated polymers. Electronic and morphological studies reveal that introduction of the fluorene unit in the DPP backbone decreases the ease of backbone oxidation and induces traps in the thin films. The combination of thin-film morphology and oxidation potentials governs the gas-absorbing properties of these materials. The ratio of responses on exposure to NO2 and NH3 compared to drifts while taking the device through repeated gate voltage sweeps is the highest for two polymers incorporating electron-donating linkers connecting the DPP and thiophene units in the backbone, in this category of organic semiconductors. The responses to NO2 were much larger than that to NH3, indicating increased susceptibility to oxidizing vs reducing gases, and that the capability of oxidizing gases to induce additional charge density has a more dramatic electronic effect than when reducing gases create traps. This work demonstrates the capability of achieving improved stability with the retention of high sensitivity in conjugated polymer-based OFET sensors by modulating redox and morphological properties of polymer semiconductors by structural control.",2021-07-19 20:41:03,3,1,76,NA,NA

From the abstract: The development of high-performance-conjugated polymer-based gas sensors involves detailed structural tailoring such that high sensitivities are achieved without compromising the stability of the fabricated devices. In this work, we systematically developed a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymer semiconductors by modifying the polymer backbone to achieve and rationalize enhancements in gas sensitivities and electronic stability in air. NO2- and NH3-responsive polymer-based organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are described with improved air stability compared to all-thiophene conjugated polymers. Five DPP–fluorene-based polymers were synthesized and compared to two control polymers and used as active layers to detect a concentration of NO2 at least as low as 0.5 ppm. The hypothesis that the less electron-donating fluorene main-chain subunit would lead to increased signal/drift compared to thiophene and carbazole subunits was tested. The sensitivities exhibited a bias voltage-dependent behavior. The proportional on-current change of OFETs using a dithienyl DPP–fluorene polymer reached ∼614% for an exposure to 20 ppm of NO2 for 5 min, testing at a bias voltage of −33 V, among the higher reported NO2 sensitivities for conjugated polymers. Electronic and morphological studies reveal that introduction of the fluorene unit in the DPP backbone decreases the ease of backbone oxidation and induces traps in the thin films. The combination of thin-film morphology and oxidation potentials governs the gas-absorbing properties of these materials.

Five DPP–fluorene-based polymers were synthesized and compared to two control polymers and used as active layers to detect a concentration of NO2 at least as low as 0.5 ppm. The hypothesis that the less electron-donating fluorene main-chain subunit would lead to increased signal/drift compared to thiophene and carbazole subunits was tested. The sensitivities exhibited a bias voltage-dependent behavior. The proportional on-current change of OFETs using a dithienyl DPP–fluorene polymer reached ∼614% for an exposure to 20 ppm of NO2 for 5 min, testing at a bias voltage of −33 V, among the higher reported NO2 sensitivities for conjugated polymers. Electronic and morphological studies reveal that introduction of the fluorene unit in the DPP backbone decreases the ease of backbone oxidation and induces traps in the thin films. The combination of thin-film morphology and oxidation potentials governs the gas-absorbing properties of these materials. The ratio of responses on exposure to NO2 and NH3 compared to drifts while taking the device through repeated gate voltage sweeps is the highest for two polymers incorporating electron-donating linkers connecting the DPP and thiophene units in the backbone, in this category of organic semiconductors. The responses to NO2 were much larger than that to NH3, indicating increased susceptibility to oxidizing vs reducing gases, and that the capability of oxidizing gases to induce additional charge density has a more dramatic electronic effect than when reducing gases create traps. This work demonstrates the capability of achieving improved stability with the retention of high sensitivity in conjugated polymer-based OFET sensors by modulating redox and morphological properties of polymer semiconductors by structural control.",2021-07-19 20:41:03,3,1,94,NA,NA

From the abstract: The nature of and the ability to control biasing across dielectrics is a key area of research for the design of more versatile organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). One important technique to achieve such control is the inclusion of donor or acceptor molecules in the dielectric to modulate charge trapping therein. In this work, we report the effects of the additive concentration on OFETs with two different arylamines blended in polystyrene (PS) dielectrics, N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-di-p-tolylbenzene-1,4-diamine (MPDA) and 4-anilinotriphenylamine (PATPA), as well as a comparison between PATPA/PS blends and dielectrics where PATPA was chemically tethered to the PS matrix. Dielectrics included in OFETs were subject to charging, and their charging capacity and stability were extracted from the OFET threshold voltages. For both MPDA/PS and PATPA/PS, blends with additive mole fractions as low as χ = 3 × 10–4 were sufficient to cause increases in the charge trapping relative to pure PS dielectrics. We observed a pronounced inverse relationship between the capacity and stability of blended systems at larger mole fractions (χ = 10–2) where the interadditive molecule distances became comparable to their size (∼1 nm). Differences between MPDA and PATPA behaviors were consistent with their different structures and sizes. Furthermore, we found a small effect on electronic trapping arising from the chemical tethering of PATPA to the PS matrix. This result was consistent with the changes made to the additive during the tethering process and small compared to the observed differences arising from the concentration. These results suggest that the average intermolecular separation is a key determinant of charge storage stability in blended dielectrics.",2021-07-19 20:18:07,5,2,16,NA,NA

In this work, we report the effects of the additive concentration on OFETs with two different arylamines blended in polystyrene (PS) dielectrics, N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-di-p-tolylbenzene-1,4-diamine (MPDA) and 4-anilinotriphenylamine (PATPA), as well as a comparison between PATPA/PS blends and dielectrics where PATPA was chemically tethered to the PS matrix. Dielectrics included in OFETs were subject to charging, and their charging capacity and stability were extracted from the OFET threshold voltages. For both MPDA/PS and PATPA/PS, blends with additive mole fractions as low as χ = 3 × 10–4 were sufficient to cause increases in the charge trapping relative to pure PS dielectrics. We observed a pronounced inverse relationship between the capacity and stability of blended systems at larger mole fractions (χ = 10–2) where the interadditive molecule distances became comparable to their size (∼1 nm). Differences between MPDA and PATPA behaviors were consistent with their different structures and sizes. Furthermore, we found a small effect on electronic trapping arising from the chemical tethering of PATPA to the PS matrix. This result was consistent with the changes made to the additive during the tethering process and small compared to the observed differences arising from the concentration. These results suggest that the average intermolecular separation is a key determinant of charge storage stability in blended dielectrics.",2021-07-19 20:18:07,5,2,17,NA,NA

"1392","doi:10.7281/T1/M4FJUL","Data associated with publication: Enhanced and unconventional responses in chemiresistive sensing devices for nitrogen dioxide and ammonia from carboxylated alkylthiophene polymers","https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/M4FJUL","The data consists of all raw and processed data pertaining to this publication. Data (Part 1) consists of compilation of semiconductor characteristics of polymers without gas exposure and with gas exposure (concentration range of ammonia and nitrogen dioxide). In addition, raw data for remote gate sensing are included. In Data (Part 2), 4 point conductivity measurements, GPC, XPS, and processed data compilations and figures are included. From the article abstract: A carboxylated thiophene polymer-based chemiresistive device in a field-effect transistor (FET) configuration with unusual and enhanced responses to the widespread pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ammonia (NH3) is described. The device based on a polymeric thiophene carboxylic acid showed a dramatic and superlinear increase in drain current (ID) of over 15000% to a ramped exposure to 10 ppm NO2 over several minutes, while its ethyl ester counterpart had significantly lower response. Devices incorporating either an ester or carboxylic acid displayed comparable and previously unreported increases in (ID from 10 ppm ramped NH3 exposure of 200–300%. Conventional poly(alkylthiophenes) showed the expected current decreases from similar NH3 exposures. Using threshold voltage shifts in silicon transistors coupled to our recently reported remote gate (RG) platform with thiophene polymer coatings, we determined that two differing response mechanisms are associated with the two gas exposures.

Here we test whether three implicit measures – eye movement monitoring (EM), pupillary dilation (PD), and event-related potentials (ERPs) – can reliably estimate vocabulary knowledge in individuals with severe autism. Five adults with severe autism were tested in a repeated-measures design with two tasks. High-frequency ‘known’ words (e.g. bus, airplane) and low-frequency ‘unknown’ words (e.g. ackee, cherimoya) were presented in a visual-world task (during which EM and PD data were collected) and a picture-word congruity task (during which ERP data were collected). Using a case study approach with single-subject analyses, we demonstrate that these implicit measures can provide estimates of receptive vocabulary knowledge in the majority of these participants. However, participants differed with respect to which measures were the most sensitive and which variables best predicted vocabulary knowledge. These implicit measures may be useful to assess language abilities in individuals with severe autism, but their use should be tailored to each individual.",2017-06-29 12:50:41,13,4,57,NA,NA

Bubbles adsorb and transport particulate matter both in industrial and marine systems. While methane-containing bubbles emitted from anoxic sediments are found extensively in aquatic ecosystems, relatively little attention has been paid to the possibility that such bubbles transport particle-associated chemical or biological material from sediments to surface waters of freshwater lakes. We quantified transport of particulate material from sediments to the surface by bubbles in Upper Mystic Lake, MA and in a 15 m tall experimental column. Vertical particle transport was positively correlated with the volume of gas bubbles released from the sediment. Particles transported by bubbles originated almost entirely in the sediment, rather than being scavenged from the water column. Concentrations of arsenic, chromium, lead, and cyanobacterial cells in bubble-transported particulate material were similar to those of bulk sediment, and particles were transported from depths exceeding 15 m, resulting in daily fluxes as large as 0.18 µg of arsenic m-2 and 2 x 104 cyanobacterial cells m-2 in the strongly stratified Upper Mystic Lake. While bubble-facilitated arsenic transport currently appears to be a modest component of total arsenic cycling in this lake, bubble-facilitated cyanobacterial transport could comprise as much as 17% of recruitment in this lake and may thus be of particular importance in large, deep, stratified lakes.",2019-10-08 13:57:17,29,4,NA,NA,NA

A detailed characterization of the aging IL10-deficient murine lung, a model of accelerated aging and frailty, reconciles features of both immunosenescence and lung aging in a coherent model. Airspace enlargement developed in the middle-aged (12-month old) and aged (20-22-month old) IL10-deficient lung punctuated by an expansion of macrophages and alveolar cell apoptosis. Compared to wild-type (WT) controls, the IL10-deficient lungs from young (4-month old) mice showed increased oxidative stress which was enhanced in both genotypes by aging. Active caspase 3 staining was increased in the alveolar epithelial cells of aged WT and mutant lungs but was greater in the IL10-deficient milieu. Lung macrophages were increased in the aged IL10-deficient lungs with exuberant expression of MMP12. IL10 treatment of naïve and M2-polarized bone marrow derived WT macrophages reduced MMP12 expression. Conditioned media studies demonstrated the secretome of aged mutant macrophages harbor reduced AECII prosurvival factors, specifically keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), promote cell death and reduce survival of primary alveolar epithelial cells. Compared to WT controls, aged IL10-deficient mice have increased parenchymal lymphoid collections comprised of a reduced number of apoptotic cells and B cells. We establish that IL10 is a key modulator of airspace homeostasis and lymphoid morphogenesis in the aging lung enabling macrophage-mediated alveolar epithelial cell survival and B cell survival within tertiary lymphoid structures.",2021-11-05 18:59:17,20,6,NA,NA,NA

Metagenomic sequencing can be used to identify how genes change in response to environmental variables. However, relatively few studies directly compare gene changes to biogeochemical model predictions of corresponding processes, especially in dynamic estuarine ecosystems. We aim to understand the major drivers of spatiotemporal shifts in microbial genes and genomes within the water column of the Chesapeake and highlight the largest discrepancies of these observations with our model predictions. We used previously published shotgun metagenomic datasets, collected across multiple months, sites, and water column positions within Chesapeake Bay in 2017, and a metatranscriptomic dataset collected at one site in the Bay in 2010-2011. We found the largest changes in the relative abundance of genes involved in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolism associated with variables that change with depth and season (e.g. pH, phosphate, water temperature). Several major trends and key relationships between genes and environmental parameters deviate from distributions expected by the model, such as discrepancies between genes mediating nitrification, higher than expected abundance and expression of denitrification genes in aerobic waters, and nitrogen fixation genes in environments with relatively high ammonia but low oxygen concentrations. While more work is needed to determine the biogeochemical consequences of gene abundance deviating from our model predictions, it provides insight into processes that can be targeted for future study to better understand factors that influence gene abundance changes in an important estuarine ecosystem.",2022-09-06 17:25:29,65,9,106,NA,NA

Metagenomic sequencing can be used to identify how genes change in response to environmental variables. However, relatively few studies directly compare gene changes to biogeochemical model predictions of corresponding processes, especially in dynamic estuarine ecosystems. We aim to understand the major drivers of spatiotemporal shifts in microbial genes and genomes within the water column of the Chesapeake and highlight the largest discrepancies of these observations with our model predictions. We used previously published shotgun metagenomic datasets, collected across multiple months, sites, and water column positions within Chesapeake Bay in 2017, and a metatranscriptomic dataset collected at one site in the Bay in 2010-2011. We found the largest changes in the relative abundance of genes involved in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolism associated with variables that change with depth and season (e.g. pH, phosphate, water temperature).
