The aim of the surveys was to assess nutritional status, diet and morbidity of preschool aged children and their mothers, and recently married, nulliparous women, and household food security, agricultural practices, participation in services and programs, among other factors, and examine associations between agricultural practices and food security, nutritional status, diet and health. The broader goal was guide policy and program interventions that may influence household food security, poverty, and the diets, health and nutrition of pre-school children and their mothers. The PoSHAN surveys were conducted in 21 sub-district units (Village Development Committees, VDCs), in 21 districts, 7 each across the Mountains, Hills and Terai (plains), sampled systematically following a random start. Within each VDC, 3 of 9 wards were systematically sampled, proportional to population size, for a total of 63 wards in the full sample. The PoSHAN surveys were conducted in the same season (~June-August) and wards every year. In addition, 1 VDC, representing an average of the 7 VDCs per zone was surveyed in two additional seasons al (sentinel) surveys to provide year-round agricultural, food security, dietary, nutritional status and other data. The first three were nationally representative (2013, 2014 and 2016) and one was conducted only in the Terai (2015) due to the 2015 Nepal earthquake which mainly affected the Hills and Mountains. This archive contains two collections: datasets for each Annual Survey 2013-2016 and Seasonal Surveys 2013-2015, and datasets associated with publications derived from the PoSHAN study.","jhu",NA,NA,NA

The aim of the surveys was to assess nutritional status, diet and morbidity of preschool aged children and their mothers, and recently married, nulliparous women, and household food security, agricultural practices, participation in services and programs, among other factors, and examine associations between agricultural practices and food security, nutritional status, diet and health. The broader goal was guide policy and program interventions that may influence household food security, poverty, and the diets, health and nutrition of pre-school children and their mothers. The PoSHAN surveys were conducted in 21 sub-district units (Village Development Committees, VDCs), in 21 districts, 7 each across the Mountains, Hills and Terai (plains), sampled systematically following a random start. Within each VDC, 3 of 9 wards were systematically sampled, proportional to population size, for a total of 63 wards in the full sample. The PoSHAN surveys were conducted in the same season (~June-August) and wards every year. In addition, 1 VDC, representing an average of the 7 VDCs per zone was surveyed in two additional seasons al (sentinel) surveys to provide year-round agricultural, food security, dietary, nutritional status and other data. The first three were nationally representative (2013, 2014 and 2016) and one was conducted only in the Terai (2015) due to the 2015 Nepal earthquake which mainly affected the Hills and Mountains.

"148",148,"Kolodkin Lab",2023-11-30,"The Kolodkin Lab at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Department of Neuroscience Research in our laboratory is focused on understanding how neuronal connectivity is established during embryonic and postnatal development. We investigate the functions of guidance cues and their receptors in axon guidance, dendritic morphology, and synapse formation and function. Current projects investigate the origins of laminar organization in the CNS, including regulation of neurite stratification in the mouse retina, and also how retinal ganglion cell axons establish connections to retinorecipient targets in the brain: with a particular interest in direction-selective visual system circuits. In addition, we study cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate laminar organization of neuronal processes in the mouse neocortex. See more at: https://www.kolodkinlab.com/","jhu",NA,NA,NA

"157",157,"JHU CCVL (Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning) Data Archive",2024-04-26,"The main goal of the CCVL (Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning) research group is to develop mathematical models of vision and cognition. These models are intended primarily for designing artificial (computer) vision systems. Learning is required for extracting knowledge from data. Practical applications include vision for the disabled. These models also serve as computational models of biological vision which can be tested by behavioral methods and, in collaborative projects, with invasive, and non-invasive neuroscience techniques. We also study how humans and animals perform cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. In addition, we also use machine learning for interpreting medical images and studying brain function.
